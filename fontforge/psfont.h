/* pfb section headers.
  There seem to be three and a half of them. the first is a the start of the
   file and is 6 bytes long "\200\001x\005\000\000", the second is right after
   the newline after eexec and is 6 bytes "\200\002I\224\000\000", the third
   is right before the zeros (after the encoded data) and is "\200\001\024\002\000\000"
   the last is at the end of file and is only two bytes "\200\003"
  I think that the \200 byte indicates a header, the next byte is 1 for ascii,
   2 for binary and 3 for eof, then next 4 bytes are the length (not present
   for eof headers) with the first byte the least significant.
