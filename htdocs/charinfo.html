  <A NAME="Unicode">This dialog </A>allows you to set the name and unicode
  encoding of a given glyph. If you know the name of the glyph then FontForge
  can tell you the encoding (if you press Set From Name), similarly if you
  know the encoding then FontForge can tell you the name.
  <P>
  The name field contains a pull down list with (possibly) several synonyms
  for the name of this unicode code point.
  <P>
  The Glyph class field is for the opentype 'GDEF' table. You can usually leave
  it set to automatic. FontForge will then figure out the class, and whether
  it should be output into GDEF. You can see what FontForge does in
  <A HREF="showatt.html">View-&gt;Show ATT</A>.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charinfo-comment.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="359" ALIGN="Right">You
  can assign an arbitrary (unicode) <A NAME="comment">comment</A> to the glyph.
  Simply type any text into this field. The comment is for your use, it will
  not go into any generated fonts. You may also assign a color to a glyph to
  make it stand out in the font view.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charinfo-pos.png" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="Right">There
  are 6 separate sub-dialogs to help you edit the
  <A NAME="features">features</A> of the <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS and
  GSUB</A> tables (some of these data can be converted into various of Apple's
  AAT tables, particularly 'morx'). The first of these is the alternate
  <A NAME="position">position</A> dialog which allows you to associate certain
  modifications to a glyph's metrics with a feature in the GPOS table.
  <P>
  In the example at right the 'fwid' feature (full width) adds 400 units to
  the glyph's advance width and moves it horizontally by 200 units.
  <P>
  A new entry in the list may be created by pressing the [New] button and a
  <A HREF="#Feature-Tag">dlg</A> will pop up with fields for the metrics you
  can change. It will also have a field for a feature tag, and a set of check
  boxes for flags (these flags are not relevant here, but are included as an
  exercise in asinine completeness.
  <P>
  The [Delete] and [Edit] buttons should be fairly self-explanatory. [Copy]
  and [Paste] work as expected too. You can also paste something copied here
  into the font view (if you wish to have the same position information available
  in a large block of glyphs).
  <P>
  The <A NAME="pairwise">pairwise</A> positioning sub-dialog allows you to
  change the positions of two glyphs when they occur next to one another. The
  most common example of that is kerning (which is better done elsewhere, the
  metricsview for example, but it can be done here if you really want to do
  that).<BR Clear=Right>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charinfo-subs.png" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="Right"> A simple
  <A NAME="substitution">substitution</A> replaces one glyph with another.
  Here the glyph "one" has a substitution to "onesuperior" when the 'sups'
  (Superscript) feature is invoked.
  <P>
  FontForge recognizes a special feature tag ' RQD' to indicate that this feature
  is required for the given script/language. Such a feature will always be
  applied.
  <P>
  You can generate a substitution most easily by dragging a glyph from the
  font view and dropping it here (you will then be
  <A HREF="#Feature-Tag">prompted for a feature tag</A> for the substitution
  table.
  <P>
  The <A NAME="multiple">multiple</A> and alternate substitution sub-dialogs
  are very similar to this one except that they can take multiple glyph names.
  In a multiple substitution sub table each glyph is replaced by several other
  glyphs (sort of the reverse of a ligature), while in the alternate substitution
  sub-dialog each glyph is to be replaced by exactly one glyph from a list
  and the user is to be given a choice as to which glyph is to be chosen.
  <BR Clear=Right>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charinfo-lig.png" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="Right"> The
  <A NAME="ligature">ligature</A> field allows you to tell FontForge that the
  current glyph is a ligature composed of several other glyphs. FontForge will
  often be able to fill this in with the right default value, but occasionally
  you may want to change it. The value should be a list of postscript glyph
  names separated by spaces. If a glyph may be viewed as two different ligatures
  then they may both be specified in different lines. For example "ffi" may
  be viewed as a ligature of "f" "f" and "i" or of "ff" and "i".
  <P>
  In the example at right the "m" glyph is one of a set of flags stored in
  the GSUB table. It indicates that combining marks should be ignored when
  looking for the ligature.
  <P>
  The <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS and GSUB</A> tables allow further refinements
  of ligatures. You may classify a ligature as: Standard, Required, Discretionary,
  Historic or Fraction. Required ligatures must be replaced, Standard ligatures
  should be, Discretionary ones may be, and Historic ones should only be used
  int appropriate circumstances. The pull down list on the Tag field allows
  you to pick what type of ligature this should be. <BR Clear=Right>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charinfo-counters.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="409" ALIGN="Right">
  In complicated Asian glyphs, postscript has a mechanism for controlling the
  width of <A NAME="CounterMasks">counters</A> between stems. These are called
  counter mask
  hints<IMG SRC="newcountermask.png" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="392" ALIGN="Left">.
  In Latin, Cyrillic, Greek fonts only glyphs like "m" are allowed to have
  counter masks, and only in very controlled conditions. See the description
  of <A HREF="hinting.html#Counter">counter masks</A>.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charinfo-counters.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="409" ALIGN="Right">
  Some <A NAME="components">glyphs</A> (ligatures, accented glyphs, Hangul
  syllables, etc.) are built up out of other glyphs (at least according to
  unicode). This pane of the dlg shows the components that Unicode says make
  up the current glyph, if those components are in the font then you can use
  FontForge's <KBD>Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Accented </KBD>or
  <KBD>Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Composite</KBD> commands to create the current
  glyph. The information displayed here is informative only, you may not change
  this field directly (it changes when you change the unicode value or glyph
  name associated with this glyph).<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <P>
  The Next and Prev buttons allow you to move from one glyph to the next (if,
  for example, you need to enter encodings for a range of glyphs).
  <P>
  The Done (or Cancel) button only Cancels work in the current glyph. If you
  have already used Next or Prev then those earlier changes will not be
  cancelled.<BR Clear=Right>

  </TABLE>
  <P>
  These two dialogs allow you to specify an otf feature tag and all the other
  impedimenta that go along with it. They are used by
  <A HREF="charinfo.html#Character">Glyph Info</A> (above) to specify
  substitutions, positions, and ligatures, as well as by
  <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Anchors">Font Info</A> to specify anchor classes and
  contextual features.
  <P>
  You must either specify an opentype feature tag (a four glyph tag like 'liga'
  -- these are defined by
  <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_tag3.html">Microsoft
  &amp; Adobe</A>, see the section on <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS and GSUB</A>
  for more information), or an apple feature/setting value (Something like
  &lt;2,2&gt; where the first number is the feature and the second the setting
  for that feature). These features tell the opentype (or ATSUI) engine what
  this substitution is supposed to do.
  <P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><BIG>CAVEAT: </BIG></STRONG></FONT>OpenType engines
  will only apply features which they believe are appropriate for the current
  script (in Latin scripts, Uniscribe will apply 'ccmp' and 'liga' (character
  composition/decomposition and ligature) features but will not apply 'medi'
  (substitution with a medial glyph variant) features because Latin doesn't
  need such a feature -- at least so they claim). Even worse, some applications
  may choose not to apply any features ever (Word does not do ligatures in
  latin).
  <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/specs/default.htm">Microsoft
  tries to document </A>what features they apply for which scripts in Uniscribe,
  but that isn't very helpful since Word and Office have quite different behavior
  than the default.
  <P>
  In <A NAME="lookup-flags">addition</A> you must specify a set of
  <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_table_formats.html">flags</A>
  which control the behavior of the feature. If your feature is to be used
  in right to left text then select that flag. If your feature is to be used
  to combine glyphs even if there are intervening mark glyphs (accents and
  such) then select Ignore Combining Marks. If you are creating an Indic font
  then you will probably need to create mark classes (with
  <A HREF="fontinfo.html#MarkClass">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Mark Classes</A>)
  which will be used with the Process Marks option to specify indic rearrangement.
  <P>
  And a collection of scripts and languages for which the substitution will
  be active. In the example above the substitution is active for the greek
  script and the default language (which here means all languages as none have
  been singled out for special treatment), the cyrillic script and the default
  language, and the latin script and several languages.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="scriptlist-pulldown.png" WIDTH="243" HEIGHT="118">
  <P>
  Clicking on the pulldown list produces a list of choices that are currently
  used in the font. The last choice allows you to change or add to this list.
  <P>
  Most of the time you will want to specify that your item should be active
  in just one script but in all languages of that script. For instance the
  "fl" ligature should probably always be applied in the latin script, no matter
  what the language is (except Turkish where ligatures should be explicitly
  disabled), however there is no point in having it active for cyrillic users
  as they will never see that combination of glyphs. On the other hand the
  es-zet ligature (German double-s, &szlig;) has fallen by the wayside in all
  (I think) languages but German so that ligature should only be active for
  the latin script, german language.
  <P>
  And there are some glyphs that don't fall into one single script. The same
  digits are used for latin, cyrillic, greek, hebrew, (sometimes arabic) and
  many other script systems, so any ligatures of the digits (such as fractions)
  should be available in all script systems.
  <P>
  The script names used by FontForge are those specified by
  <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_tag1.html">Microsoft
  and Adobe for opentype</A>. These are almost compatible with
  <A HREF="http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso15924/document/dis15924.pdf">ISO
  15924</A> except that all opentype scripts are in lower case (while those
  in ISO 15924 all start with capital letters) and short script names (such
  as "Lao") are converted to 'lao ' rather than 'Laoo'. I have extended the
  set of opentype scripts with many of those in ISO 15924 by making them all
  lower case (I have not used everything from ISO 15924 because it contains
  script variants for things which I consider to be one script (eg. fraktur
  has a separate script tag, but I consider it to be latin).

  <IMG SRC="scriptlist.png" WIDTH="296" HEIGHT="205" ALIGN="Left">This dialog
  shows all the script and language combinations which are in use in the current
  font. You may add a new combination or change an old one by pressing the
  obvious buttons.
  <P>
  If you want to specify a script or language that FontForge doesn't know about,
  then hold the control key down when pressing the [New...] or [Edit] buttons
  and you will get an unparsed dlg which will allow you to enter whatever you
  like (OpenType does not give a tag for the default language (it is has a
  special representation which does not involve tags), but for the sake of
  consistency I have assigned it the tag of 'dflt'. No 'dflt' tags will appear
  in the output font, instead they will be converted to the appropriate
  representation for the default language).
  <P>
  The language names used by FontForge are those specified by
  <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_tag2.html">Microsoft
  and Adobe for opentype</A>.
  <P>
  Note: In most cases the order of scripts in the list is irrelevant, but kerning
  uses the initial script to determine the direction of the kern pair. So if
  you have kerning on the digits, and want those to be active in both latin
  and hebrew, you must use the unparsed dlg which allows you to order the scripts
  yourself (or add a greek, or cyrillic script to the list (something that
  comes before hebrew in alphabetic order and is left to right)).<BR CLEAR=ALL>
