The View Menu
=============

.. _viewmenu.Fit:

.. object:: Fit

   In the outline and bitmap views this will scale the current glyph to the
   largest setting where it all fits in the view.

.. _viewmenu.Out:

.. object:: Zoom Out

   Not in the font view. Centered on the middle selection if there is one, else
   the middle of the view.

.. _viewmenu.In:

.. object:: Zoom In

   Not in the font view. Centered on the middle selection if there is one, else
   the middle of the view.

.. _viewmenu.Next:

.. object:: Next Glyph

   In the metrics, outline and bitmap view this changes the current glyph to be
   the next one in the font.

   In the font view this selects the next glyph in the font (and scrolls, if
   necessary, to display that glyph).

.. _viewmenu.Prev:

.. object:: Prev Glyph

   In the metrics, outline and bitmap view this changes the current glyph to be
   the previous one in the font.

   In the font view this selects the next glyph in the font (and scrolls, if
   necessary, to display that glyph).

.. _viewmenu.NextDef:

.. object:: Next Defined Glyph

   Similar to Next Glyph, except it moves to the next glyph defined in the font.

.. _viewmenu.PrevDef:

.. object:: Prev Defined Glyph

   Similar to Prev Glyph, except it moves to the previous glyph defined in the
   font.

.. _viewmenu.Former:

.. object:: Former Glyph

   Changes the glyph window to look at whatever glyph was being edited there
   before this one (one level of history).

.. _viewmenu.Substitutions:

.. object:: Substitutions

   Brings up a sub menu showing all the GSUB type 1 and type 3 substitutions
   (simple and alternate) you have defined for the selected glyph and allows you
   to change the glyph as directed by the substitution. Also contains an entry
   to return you to the original glyph.

   Substitutions may be set with the :doc:`Element->Glyph Info </ui/dialogs/charinfo>`
   command.

.. _viewmenu.Goto:

.. object:: Goto
            Replace Glyph...

   In the Font, Outline, Bitmap and Metrics views this brings up a dialog in
   which you may type either:

   * A name of a glyph in the current font
   * A number (in either decimal or hex) indicating the glyph you are interested
     in, in the current encoding
   * A hex number ,preceded by "U+" or "uni" or "u", indicating the character you
     are interested in in unicode.
   * A decimal number, preceded by "glyph" ,indicating the glyph index in the
     original glyph list.
   * A ku ten representation of a CJK font (two comma separated numbers)
   * A standard name (which need not be used in the current font) but which can be
     mapped to a unicode value.
   * For 2/4 byte encodings you will also be shown a pull-down list of unicode
     ranges (Things like "Greek", "Katakana", "Hangul Compatibility Jamo") and you
     can select one of the range names.
   * Arabic letters may also be named as: ``afii57442.isolated`` or
     ``0x642.initial``
   * A single unicode character

   In the font view the view will scroll so that this glyph is visible and it
   will be selected

   In the bitmap, outline and metrics views, the current glyph will change to be
   the one specified.

.. _viewmenu.InsBeforeAfter:

.. object:: Insert Glyph Before...
            Insert Glyph After...

   In the metrics view this brings up a dialog similar to the previous one
   allowing you to enter a glyph by name or encoding either before or after the
   currently selected position.

.. _viewmenu.FVLayers:

.. object:: Layers

   A submenu which only appears in the font view. It lets you chose which layer
   to display in the font view.

.. _viewmenu.FindInFV:

.. object:: Find In Font View

   In the outline, bitmap and metrics views this will scroll the associated font
   view so that the current glyph is displayed (and selected) in the fontview.

.. _viewmenu.ShowATT:

.. object:: Show ATT

   Only in the font view. Brings up a :doc:`dlg </ui/dialogs/showatt>` showing the advanced
   typographic tables (GPOS/GSUB or morx/kern) that FontForge supports.

.. _viewmenu.DspSubs:

.. object:: Display Substitutions

   Only in the font view. This allows you to select a simple substitution, any
   glyph with that substitution attached will be displayed as the substituted
   glyph. Any glyph without such a substitution will be left blank. Double
   clicking on a glyph will either go the substituted version or will create a
   substituted version and go to that. (However almost no other commands will be
   aware of this mapping, which will probably be confusing).

   .. rubric:: Displaying small caps ('smcp' substitution)

   .. flex-grid::

      * - .. image:: /images/fv-normal.png
        - .. image:: /images/fv-smallcaps.png

.. object:: Combinations

   A submenu containing

   .. _viewmenu.KernPairs:

   .. object:: Kern Pairs

      This :doc:`brings up a dialog showing all kerning pairs </ui/dialogs/kernpairs>` in
      the current font (or, if invoked from the outline glyph view, a list of
      all kerning pairs involving that glyph). You may alter kerning pairs here
      too.

   .. _viewmenu.AnchoredPairs:

   .. object:: Anchored Pairs

      This may have a sub-menu of its own containing all the anchor classes for
      this font and an entry "All". You may choose to see all combinations of
      glyphs from a given anchor class, or all combinations from all anchored
      classes.

      If invoked from the outline glyph view it will provide a list of all
      anchored combinations involving that glyph.

      Selecting a combination and double clicking on it will bring up an
      :doc:`Anchor Control </ui/dialogs/anchorcontrol>` dialog.

   .. _viewmenu.AControl:

   .. object:: Anchor Control

      Only in the outline view. Has a submenu of all anchor points in this
      glyph. Selecting one brings upt the :doc:`Anchor Control </ui/dialogs/anchorcontrol>`
      dialog.

   .. _viewmenu.Glyph:

   .. object:: Anchor Glyph at Point

      Only in the outline view. Allows you to attach and display another glyph
      at the selected anchor point.

   .. _viewmenu.Ligatures:

   .. object:: Ligatures

      This brings up a dialog showing the names of all ligatures and of the
      glyphs that compose them (if invoked from the outline glyph view, a list
      of all ligatures containing that glyph). Double clicking on an entry will
      bring up a window showing that ligature.

.. _viewmenu.GlyphLabel:

.. object:: Label Glyph By

   In the font view each glyph has a label above it. This may be either:

   * An image of the glyph (from a conventional font)
   * The name of the glyph
   * The unicode code point associated with the glyph
   * The glyph's encoding (in hex)

   Note that when the glyphs are small (the 24 pixel view, for example) there
   may not be room for the entire name of each glyph (or even for the encoding),
   so the labels may be truncated.

.. _viewmenu.HMetrics:

.. object:: View H. Metrics...

   In the font view this will control which of the horizontal metrics lines are
   draw across the displayed glyphs. In the outline glyph view the same
   functionality is available from one of the palettes.
   :ref:`See the font view for more information <fontview.metrics>`

.. _viewmenu.VMetrics:

.. object:: View V. Metrics...

   In the font view this will control which of the vertical metrics lines are
   draw across the displayed glyphs. In the outline glyph view the same
   functionality is available from one of the palettes. (This will be greyed out
   if your font does not have vertical metrics in it).
   :ref:`See the font view for more information <fontview.metrics>`

.. _viewmenu.32x8:

.. object:: 32x8 cell window

   In the font view you may explicitly set the window size so that there are 32
   glyph cells horizontally and 8 vertically.

.. _viewmenu.16x4:

.. object:: 16x4 cell window

   In the font view you may explicitly set the window size so that there are 16
   glyph cells horizontally and 4 vertically.

.. _viewmenu.8x2:

.. object:: 8x2 cell window

   In the font view you may explicitly set the window size so that there are 8
   glyph cells horizontally and 2 vertically.

.. _viewmenu.px24:

.. object:: 24 pixel outline

   In the font view you may choose how large you want the rasterized
   representation of the outline view to be. The default is to rasterize it on a
   24 pixel block. If this item is checked then a 24 pixel version of the
   outline font is displayed, selecting it will display a 24 pixel version of
   the font.

   (Exactly one em-square of the glyph will be displayed, if the glyph extends
   above the ascent or below the descent those features will be clipped)

.. _viewmenu.px36:

.. object:: 36 pixel outline

   Similar to the above but for a 36 pixel version.

.. _viewmenu.px48:

.. object:: 48 pixel outline

   Similar to the above but for a 48 pixel version.

.. _viewmenu.px72:

.. object:: 72 pixel outline

   Similar to the above but for a 72 pixel version.

.. _viewmenu.px96:

.. object:: 96 pixel outline

   Similar to the above but for a 96 pixel version.

.. _viewmenu.AntiAlias:

.. object:: AntiAlias

   Only in the font and metrics view. Toggles between whether the font displayed
   in the view is a bitmapped font or an anti-aliased font. An Anti-aliased font
   shows levels of grey rather than just black and white. It often looks better
   than a bitmap, but it is slower to generate and draw.

.. _viewmenu.Vertical:

.. object:: Vertical

   Only in the metrics view. Toggles between displaying horizontal and vertical
   metrics. (Only available if
   :menuselection:`Element --> Font Info --> General --> Has Vertical Metrics`
   is set).

.. _viewmenu.FitToEm:

.. object:: Fit To Em

   Only in the font view. The fontview will either display glyphs scaled so that
   the font's bounding box fits in the window, or so that the em fits in the
   window. The advantage of the first method is that you see all of each glyph,
   the advantage of the second is that you can see how the letter sizes compare
   from font to font.

   :small:`(This is something of a simplification. In bounding box mode the displayed font is scaled so that the vertical size (as found in the bounding box) fits it the window. Very wide glyphs will still not fit horizontally. Also the scaling is not updated when glyphs change, if you have changed the maximum bounds of the font you might want to force a rescale by toggling this mode)`

.. _viewmenu.BitmapMag:

.. object:: Bitmap Magnification...

   In the font view. When displaying a bitmap font it is sometimes desirable to
   look at the font with a greater magnification than normal.

.. _viewmenu.bitmaps:

.. object:: <list of bitmap pixel sizes, if any>

   In the font view or metrics view there is a list of all generated bitmap
   fonts. You may select to have one of them displayed in the view rather than a
   rasterized version of the outline font. If one is checked then that one is
   currently displayed, if you select one then it will be displayed.

   In CID keyed fonts this list will not be present.

   If your font database includes some greymap fonts then these will be listed
   here too, as usual they will be displayed as <pixel-size>@<bits-per-pixel>

.. _viewmenu.Grid:

.. object:: Show/Hide Grid

   In the Metrics View this entry allows you to turn on or off the lines marking
   the edges of the glyphs on display. There are 4 levels

   * Show Grid -- Always show the full grid lines
   * Partial Grid -- Show short lines at the top and bottom of the window so the
     line will not be distracting when examining spacing
   * Hide when moving -- Show the full grid line normally, but it will vanish
     while the user adjusts spacing with the mouse
   * Hode Grid -- Always hide the grid.

.. _viewmenu.Outline:

.. object:: Outline

   In the Metrics View this will be checked when the outline font is bring
   displayed. Selecting it will display the outline font (rather than a bitmap
   font).

.. _viewmenu.NumPts:

.. object:: Number Points

   In the Outline view, this small sub-menu allows you to control whether point
   numbers are displayed next to points in the foreground view. This is
   primarily for TrueType, where the instructions use these numbers to refer to
   the points when they do grid-fitting. The numbering scheme is a little
   different depending on what the expected output (input) will be, so we have a
   sub-menu listing output types.

.. object:: Show Grid Fit

   .. _viewmenu.ShowGridFit:

   .. object:: Show Grid Fit

      In the Outline view and only if the freetype library is available. Brings
      up a :ref:`dialog <charview.GridFit>` which allows you to control whether
      a grid fit version of the splines in the font is displayed.

   .. _viewmenu.GFBigger:

   .. object:: Bigger Point Size

      In the Outline view, if grid fitting is turned on, this will increase the
      point size (note, this is slightly different from increasing the pixel
      size).

   .. _viewmenu.GFSmaller:

   .. object:: Smaller Point Size

      In the Outline view, if grid fitting is turned on, this will decrease the
      point size.

   .. _viewmenu.GFAntiAlias:

   .. object:: Anti-Alias

      In the Outline view, if grid fitting is turned on, this will toggle whether
      the display is in anti alias mode.

   .. _viewmenu.GFOff:

   .. object:: Off

      Turns off grid fitting.

.. object:: Show

   This submenu is only in the outline glyph view.

   .. _viewmenu.Points:

   .. object:: Points

      This hides or displays the points in the outline glyph view.

   .. _viewmenu.CpInfo:

   .. object:: Show Control Point Info

      In the Outline view, when you move a
      :ref:`control point <charview.CpInfo>` this mode pops up a little window
      showing various bits of information about the control point you are
      editing.

   .. _viewmenu.Extrema:

   .. object:: Extrema

      In the Outline view,

      .. image:: /images/extrema-poi.png
         :align: right

      in postscript and truetype fonts (in almost all cases) should have their
      horizontal and vertical extrema at the endpoints of splines. This setting
      will mark extremal endpoints by coloring them a dull purple to remind you
      that you should not delete them. If an extremum occurs somewhere other
      than an end point a crosshair will be drawn around it. You might consider
      doing :ref:`Element->Add Extrema <elementmenu.Add-Extrema>` in this case
      (or you might not, this can be ok in some cases).

   .. _viewmenu.PoI:

   .. object:: Points of Inflection

      In the Outline view, points of inflection occur where the change in the
      slope of the curve (second derivative) changes sign. Quadratic splines
      (truetype) cannot represent points of inflection. If you have a postscript
      font which you intend to convert to truetype it can be helpful to know
      where these difficult points lie. (the cubic->quadratic approximation
      routines will often add intermediate points at these points of inflection)

   .. _viewmenu.HVLines:

   .. object:: Almost Horizontal/Vertical Lines

      If a line is almost, but not quite horizontal or vertical then draw the
      line in a different color to show visually that it should be fixed.

   .. _viewmenu.HVCurves:

   .. object:: Almost Horizontal/Vertical Curves

      If a curve is almost, but not quite horizontal or vertical at one of its
      endpoints then draw little tick marks at the end point to indicate this.

   .. _viewmenu.DefineAlmost:

   .. object:: (Define Almost)

      Define what "almost" means, as used in the above two commands.

   .. _viewmenu.Bearings:

   .. object:: Side Bearings

      Draws little lines to mark the left and right side bearings of a glyph.

   .. _viewmenu.Fill:

   .. object:: Fill

      In the Outline view this fills in the glyph outline as you edit it. (this
      can be very slow. If the glyph is too big (too magnified) then filling
      will not be done).

   .. _viewmenu.Preview:

   .. object:: Preview

      A preview mode hides points, hints, various other stuff and fills the
      outline to give a better feeel of the glyph's looks. Besides usual
      shortcut toggling it on and off - **Ctrl+[*key above Tab*]** (eg,
      **Ctrl+`** on a US keyboard) - it can be also used by holding that **[*key above Tab*]** down (unless quick navigation is enabled).

   .. _viewmenu.Palettes:

   .. object:: Palettes

      .. _viewmenu.Tools:

      .. object:: Tools

         If this item is checked then the tools palette (in the outline and
         bitmap views) is visible. Selecting it toggles whether the palette is
         visible or not.

      .. _viewmenu.Layers:

      .. object:: Layers

         If this item is checked then the layers palette (in the outline and
         bitmap views) is visible. Selecting it toggles whether the palette is
         visible or not.

      .. _viewmenu.Shades:

      .. object:: Shades

         Only in the bitmap view, and only if editing grey-scale (anti-aliased)
         fonts. Controls whether the shades of grey palette is visible or not.

      .. _viewmenu.Dock:

      .. object:: Dock Palettes

         Allows you to control whether you want the palettes free standing or
         docked in the current view.

         The window manager under gnome does not handle this properly. If you
         want docked palettes under gnome: Open a window with palettes, select
         docked palettes (the palettes will not dock), close the window, reopen
         the window. The palettes are now docked and should be from here on.

   .. _viewmenu.GTabs:

   .. object:: Glyph Tabs

      Controls whether the outline glyph view has a set of tabs of past glyphs
      viewed in that window.

   .. _viewmenu.Rulers:

   .. object:: Rulers

      In the Glyph Outline View toggles whether rulers appear at the top and to
      the left of the editing area.

   .. _viewmenu.HHints:

   .. object:: Horizontal Hints

      Controls whether horizontal hints are visible

   .. _viewmenu.VHints:

   .. object:: Vertical Hints

      Controls whether vertical hints are visible

   .. _viewmenu.DHints:

   .. object:: Diagonal Hints

      Controls whether diagonal hints are visible

   .. _viewmenu.BlueValues:

   .. object:: BlueValues

      Controls whether the glyph's PostScript BlueValues are visible

   .. _viewmenu.FamilyBlues:

   .. object:: FamilyBlues

      Controls whether the glyph's PostScript FamilyBlues are visible.

   .. _viewmenu.Anchors:

   .. object:: Anchors

      Controls whether Anchor points are visible

   .. _viewmenu.CV-HMetrics:

   .. object:: Horizontal Metrics

      Controls whether horizontal metrics lines (the width line) are visible.

   .. _viewmenu.CV-VMetrics:

   .. object:: Vertical Metrics

      Controls whether vertical metrics lines (the vertical advance line) are
      visible.

   .. object:: Snap Outlines to Pixel Grid

      Cairo can draw contours with sub-pixel resolution -- which means that if a
      spline's end point falls somewhere between two pixels then cairo will draw
      a bit of the contour on both pixels this leads to an often undesirable
      level of fuzziness. In some sense it provides a more accurate indication
      of where the spline goes. This menu item can be used to turn that on and
      off.

.. _viewmenu.Bigger:

.. object:: Bigger Pixel Size

   In the bitmap view this displays the current glyph in next larger bitmap font
   (if there is one)

.. _viewmenu.Smaller:

.. object:: Smaller Pixel Size

   In the bitmap view this displays the current glyph in next smaller bitmap
   font (if there is one)
