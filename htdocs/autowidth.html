  <P>
  The Auto Width command will attempt to guess reasonable widths (more accurately
  reasonable left and right side bearings) for your font. The command looks
  at all possible combinations of indicated glyphs (if you request more than
  300 glyphs it will only look at the first 300 to avoid running out of memory
  (300*300 takes up a fair amount of room).
  <P>
  Do <FONT COLOR="Red"><EM>NOT </EM></FONT>attempt to mix scripts that are
  not artistically similar. FontForge will be very confused if you try to run
  autowidth on a Latin "I" and a Hebrew "Alef". Latin, Greek and Cyrillic can
  usually be intermixed since they evolved together and the letterforms are
  similar.
  <P>
  You must specify two different sets, one for the glyph on the left (which
  will have its right side bearing adjusted) and one for the glyph on the right
  (which will have its left side bearing adjusted. I know that sounds backwards
  but think about it a little), of course these two sets may be the same. You
  may apply the command to all glyphs in the font (if there are few than 300
  of course), to all the selected glyphs, the the glyphs A-Z, a-z and 0-9,
  to similar combinations for greek and cyrillic, or to a list of glyphs you
  specify yourself (glyphs may be specified either by themselves or by a range,
  so "ace-g" means the glyphs a, c, e, f and g (if you put commas and spaces
  in the list they will be treated as glyphs. If you want to specify a hyphen,
  put it first or last, so "-a-z" means hyphen and all letters a-z)).
  <A HREF="metricsview.html#Entering">For information on entering non-ASCII
  characters see that section in the metrics view</A>, ranges are based on
  Unicode code points.
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="autowidthmenu.png" WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="268" ALIGN="Right">Last
  of all the Spacing text box allows you to say how close you want the glyphs
  to be. If you look at a sanserif capital I, and you autowidth it with itself
  (and nothing else) the sum of the left and right side bearings should be
  equal to the spacing. By default the spacing will be set to the size of the
  lower case n. If you have serifs and curved letters things are more complex,
  but that is roughly what's going on. You may need to adjust it to suit your
  own preferences.
  <P>
  Adjusting the left and right bearings of a letter will also adjust the left
  and right bearings of all accented letters based (by reference) on it. You
  should not try to use AutoWidth on accented letters directly (unless those
  glyphs do not use references).<BR Clear=Right>
  <H2 ALIGN=Center>
    <A NAME="AutoKern">Auto
    Kern</A><IMG SRC="autokern.png" WIDTH="437" HEIGHT="311" ALIGN="Right">
  </H2>
  <P>
  The Auto Kern dialog looks similar to the Auto Width dialog above.
  <P>
  The Spacing entry defaults slightly differently, it will be the sum of the
  left and right bearings for the capital I (it is assumed that the font has
  already been spaced, so this will give a more accurate value than using the
  size of an "n").
  <P>
  The threshold says that any kern pair whose absolute value is less than the
  threshold value will be ignored. Set this to 0 if you want all kerns.
  <P>
  Some systems have a maximum number of kerning pairs that they can deal with.
  If this is true for you then set "Total Kerns" to this value.
  <P>
  The glyphs are specified as they are for AutoWidth above, except that here
  it is also possible to load a set of kerning pairs out of a file. For instance
  in the dlg at right many unnecessary letter combinations will be checked,
  and kerning information generated for them, (the combination "xq" might well
  generate a kern, that letter pair will almost never occur in written English
  (or any other language)). Instead you can specify (with the [Browse...] button)
  that a file should be read, and only those pairs found in the file used.
  <P>
  I have provided a <A HREF="englishkernpairs.txt">sample file </A>containing
  some kerning pairs common in English (it is actually copied from
  <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5091.Design_MM_Fonts.pdf">Adobe
  Technical Note 5091</A>). The format of this file is just a set of lines
  containing two glyphs per line. A kerning pair will be checked for each pair
  of glyphs (any lines with more or fewer glyphs than 2 will be treated as
  comment lines and ignored). The file may be either in latin1 encoding or
  in UCS2 (if in UCS2 it should begin with the byte order marker U+FEFF). You
  may also specify a glyph by writing out U+xxxx where xxxx gives the unicode
  encoding. So "Av" could be represented as "U+0041v".
  <P>
  Finally you must specify the <A HREF="lookups.html">lookup subtable</A> which
  will own the kerning pairs.
  <P>
  For each glyph pair, it will set the sum of <BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;right bearing of
  left glyph&gt; + &lt;left bearing of right glyph&gt; + &lt;kern&gt; =
  &lt;spacing&gt; + &lt;glyph shape fudge factor&gt;.
  <P>
  The "fudge factor" is determined by looking at the shape of the left and
  right edges of the glyphs (ignoring the areas that are in serifs). It looks
  for the closest approach of the two glyphs and performs a complicated average
  to figure out the fudge. If that fudge would lead to a &lt;kern&gt; which
  causes any glyphs to be too close together then it is adjusted up. The exact
  method is subject to change as bugs are found.
  <P>
  If the absolute value of a &lt;kern&gt; is less than the threshold then no
  kerning information will be produced for that pair of glyphs. If the algorithm
  (and any previously existing kern pairs) lead to more pairs than specified
  by "Total Kerns" then a new threshold value will be determined and any pairs
  whose &lt;kern&gt; is less (in absolute value) than this new threshold will
  be removed.
  <P>
  Kerning information will not be propagated from base glyphs to accented glyphs
  which refer to them. This is because "Ve" will probably have a rather different
  kerning value than "V&egrave;". Note that this is different from the way
  AutoWidth behaves.
  <P>
  Remember kerning is not part of a PostScript&reg; font, whatever word processor
  you use needs to read the kerning information from the afm file and, while
  kerning is part of truetype (and opentype) fonts, the Windows does not support
  kerning either.
