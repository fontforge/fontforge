You may also want to install the

useful libraries (see the <A HREF="#Dependencies">dependencies</A> section

    <A NAME="Configuring-X11">Configuring</A> X11
  </H4>
  <P>
  <CODE>X11-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Input</CODE>
  <P>
  FontForge is designed to make use of a three button mouse. It is also designed
  to make use of modifier key modes on mouse clicks (so Control left click
  can mean something different than left click). If you have a three (or two)
  button mouse then use it (and turn off "<CODE>Emulate three button
  mouse</CODE>" in the X11 preferences). If you have a standard one button
  mouse then you have the option of having the mac simulate a three button
  mouse (for instance Option mouse click behaves like clicking the middle mouse
  button). Unfortunately this means you can no longer use the Option key to
  change the behavior of the left (only) button click. So either choice means
  you lose capabilities.
  <P>
  Normally X11 is configured so that the Command key (cloverleaf) is bound
  to the X11 menu bar, and not to fontforge's. When fontforge starts it checks
  this, and if X11 gets command then fontforge configures its menubar to use
  Control rather than command. This isn't very mac-like. If you turn <B>off</B>
  the "<CODE>Enable keyboard shortcuts under X11</CODE>" preference item then
  fontforge will configure its menubar to make use of Command.
  <P>
  If type the following into a terminal (or xterm) window

I post mac install packages on

the file release system, but you get the file eventually.
<P>
I currently post builds for Mac 10.5 &amp; 10.4 (I post different builds for the
two systems because they provide different python libraries).
<p>
<STRONG>Neither of
these builds will work on 10.3</STRONG>. If you wish a 10.3 you can build from
current source or find a build from 2006. If you wish a 10.2 or earlier build
the current sources will not work and you must delve more deeply into the past.

You must then start up a Terminal window (the Terminal Application also lives
in the Utilities sub-folder of the Applications folder) and be prepared to
type commands in that window (I know, it's very un-mac-like).

  Building and installing from <A NAME="src-source">source</A>
</H2>
<H3>
  Obtaining a source <A NAME="src-distribution">distribution</A>
</H3>
<P>
There are two basic ways to obtain a source distribution. One is by downloading
an entire source tree from the web, and the other is by using the cvs utility
to maintain a source tree on your machine which will be as up to date as
possible. The former solution provides more stability, the latter provides
access to cutting edge bugs.

<P>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&amp;package_id=114328">Sourceforge's
file release system </A>will contain a tarball (a file with the extension
for .tar.bz2).
<P>
After you have downloaded one of these packages, either copy the tarball
to where you are, or move to the directory containing the tarball (I can't
provide explicit instructions here, because I don't know where your browser
put the file) and type (<SMALL>The "$" or "#" are example prompts from the
computer. Do not type them yourself</SMALL>):

  from the <A NAME="src-cvs">cvs</A> tree
</H4>
<P>
cvs is a nifty set of utilities which allows concurrent access to a source
tree by many users. To set up your own (local) copy of the cvs tree (including
documentation), create a new directory, cd into it and type the following
(when it asks for a password, just hit return):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs1.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fontforge login

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Once you have established a directory you may update it to obtain the most
recent version of the source by typing:

<P>
You can also
<A HREF="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/fontforge/fontforge/">browse
the CVS tree</A> online. Or see
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=103338">sourceforge's description
</A>for more information (their information is out of date, the correct server
is cvs1.sf.net not cvs.sf.net), or read the

<H3>
  <A NAME="src-Building">Building</A> &amp; installing it

<P>
Now you have the source installed on your system and you should be positioned
at the top directory of that tree. You need to configure your package (this

it (do not type "$"):

If you don't want to install X11 on your system, you can use fontforge as
a command line tool which can execute scripts to manipulate fonts. FontForge
supports <A HREF="http://fontforge.sf.net/python.html">python scripting</A>

  <A NAME="Dependencies">Dependencies</A> (external libraries/helper programs)
</H2>
<P>
FontForge tries to avoid hard dependencies. If a library is missing then
fontforge will (in most cases) be able to continue to run, it will just lack
whatever functionality the library provides. So if you don't need to import
tiff images, you don't need libtiff. If you don't need to handle SVG fonts
you don't need libxml2, etc.
<P>
With the appropriate libraries, FontForge can import png, tiff, and gif images
to act as character backgrounds for tracing purposes (FontForge can import
bmp and xbm formats without external libraries). With libxml2 FontForge can
read SVG fonts. With the freetype library FontForge will do a better job
making bitmap characters for you. libuninameslist provides standard unicode
names and annotations for unicode characters (it has been localized into
English and French)
<P>
None is required for the proper compilation/execution of FontForge, if the
libraries are not present they will not be used. (If the machine on which
your executable was build didn't have them, then you must not only install
the libraries, but <A HREF="#source">rebuild fontforge from source</A>) If
your machine doesn't have them and you want them they are available from:

      <A HREF="http://x.org/">libX</A><BR>
      Normally FontForge depends on the X11 windowing system, but if you are just

      on systems without X (the configure script should figure this out).
    <LI>
      <A HREF="http://www.cairographics.org/">libcairo</A><BR>
      Cairo handles drawing anti-aliased splines in the outline glyph view. It
      is dependent on libfontconfig, libXft and perhaps other libraries.
    <LI>
      <A HREF="http://www.pango.org/">libpango</A><BR>
      Pango draws text for complex scripts. It depends on glib-2.0, libfontconfig,
      libfreetype, libXft, and perhaps other libraries.
  <LI>
    Under Mac OS/X these libraries are available from the
    <A HREF="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink project</A> and from

  <A NAME="suggested-fonts">Once</A> upon a time, fontforge only used X11 bitmap

<P>
  There seem plenty of good unicode outline fonts, so I shan't provide any
  suggestions. To install them you simply create a subfolder called .fonts in
  your home folder, and then copy the font file into that subdirectory.
  <FONT COLOR="RED"><STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> pango uses opentype to
  layout complex scripts. Most fonts on your macintosh are in a different
  format -- glyphs from them will display fine (so they work for latin, greek
  cyrillic, japanese, chinese, etc.) but more complex features will probably
  not work (so Arabic and Indic scripts may not be displayed properly).</FONT>
<P>
  In the old days there weren't
  many bitmap fonts with good unicode coverage so I provided a list of suggested

Once you have downloaded the documentation tarball as described above, you
should move to the directory containing it, and type:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>sudo sh
password: ******
# mkdir -p /usr/local/share/doc/fontforge
# mv fontforge_htdocs*.tgz /usr/local/share/doc/fontforge

<P>
After doing this fontforge will be able to find the docs on your system when
you press the [F1] (or [Help]) key. If you don't do this fontforge will attempt
to find documentation online.

  Starting FontForge
</H2>
<H3>
  On the <A NAME="run-mac">mac</A>
</H3>
  FontForge now installs itself as a mac application in the Applications folder.
  You can start FontForge the way you start any other application, double clicking
  on it, dragging files to it, etc.
  <P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT><CODE>FontForge</CODE>
  and <CODE>Font Book</CODE> may fight over which will open standard fonts
  if you double click on the font file. Both claim they can open these files,
  neither claims to be the prefered application for them. If an .otf file shows
  a fontforge
  icon
  it will be opened by fontforge, if a font book icon it will be opened by
  font book. Dragging a font file to the desired application will always
  work. Or you
  can select the font, and invoke <CODE>File-&gt;Get Info</CODE> (in the Finder's
  menu) and use the "Open with" control to select an application.
  <P>
  On the mac the Option key is used to invoke the functionality that fontforge's
  docs call "Alt" or "Meta". (See the section on
  <A HREF=#Configuring-X11">X11 configuration</A> for notes
  on three button mice and the command key).
    <HR>
  <P>
  You can also start fontforge using traditional unix methods
<P>
Before you start fontforge on the mac you must start the X11 server. You
can do this by opening the Applications folder, and then opening the Utilities
folder, and then double-clicking on "X11". (If you don't have X11 there then
refer back to the <A HREF="#Before">instructions for installing it</A>)
<P>
Having done that there should be a menubar with a menu labeled "Applications".
Click on this. There should be a "FontForge" entry in it. Selection FontForge
will start fontforge and bring up a dialog allowing you to open a font or
create a new one.
<P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>FontForge does not normally
  show mac resource fonts in this dialog -- however it can still open one even
  it it isn't displayed. Simply type in the name of the file containing it.
  (or change the Filter field to "All Files").
<P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>Normally FontForge will
  never see the command key shortcuts. X11 intercepts these and uses them itself.
  If you would like to be able to use Command-Q to quit FontForge then
  <UL>
    <LI>
      Make sure the X11 menu bar is visible
    <LI>
      Select the menu item <CODE>X11-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Input</CODE>
    <LI>
      turn off (uncheck) <CODE>[] Enable keyboard shortcuts under X11</CODE>
  </UL>
<P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>FontForge was written assuming
  the availability of a three button mouse. Under 10.4 X11 simulates this by
  creating a virtual three button mouse where the middle button is invoked
  by Option-Mouse click and the right button by Command-Mouse click. (You can
  also control this from X11-&gt;Preferences).
<P>
If the Applications menu does not contain a "FontForge" entry, you can add
one yourself:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Select Applications-&gt;Customize Menu
  <LI>
    Then press the (Add) button in the dialog that appears
  <LI>
    Double click in the left-most section of the blank line which just appeared
    and then type "FontForge"
  <LI>
    Press the [Tab] key and type "/usr/local/bin/fontforge"
  <LI>
    Press the [Tab] key again and type "f"
  <LI>
    Then press (Done)
</UL>
<P>
(You may also start fontforge from the command line here. Go to the Applications
menu and select Terminal or xterm, and look at <A HREF="README-Mac.html#Starting">the
section after the next</A>.
<H3>
  Notes on the <A NAME="PATH">PATH</A> variable
</H3>
<P>
On most systems fontforge will install itself into <KBD>/usr/local/bin</KBD>
(that's the standard place for optional software), and this is not always
in the default search path for commands (grrrr). Which means you might have
everything properly installed, but nothing actually works from the command
line. If you see messages like <KBD>"fontforge: command not found."</KBD>
this has (probably) happened to you.
<P>
So what do you do?
<P>
You need to set the PATH environment variable so that it includes /usr/local/bin.
The value of the PATH variable is a set of directories separated by colons.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>echo $PATH
/home/gww/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/sbin
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Unfortunately there are several ways of doing this because there are two different
conventions used by unix shells. And the mac has yet a third way which only works
sometimes. Type:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If the name of your shell is <KBD>bash</KBD> (as above), <KBD>ksh</KBD> or
<KBD>sh</KBD> then you want to type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH ; export PATH
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If the name of your shell is <KBD>tcsh</KBD> or <KBD>csh</KBD> then you say
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
But you'd have to do that every time you logged in. Instead you want this
included in the shell's initialization. Again there are two cases, for the
<KBD>bash</KBD> family of shells you want to edit the file
<KBD>~/.bashrc</KBD> while for the <KBD>csh</KBD> family you want to edit
the file <KBD>~/.cshrc</KBD>. On a bash system the following command is generally
sufficient:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cat &gt;&gt;~/.bashrc
PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH ; export PATH
^D
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
(where <KBD>^D</KBD> represents control-D, obtained by holding down the control
key while depressing <KBD>d</KBD>. <BR>
And for the csh family you would type:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cat &gt;&gt;~/.cshrc
setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH
^D
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
On the mac you may also want to download the <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/environmentvariablepreferencepane.html">environment
preference plugin</a> and install the environment variable there. Note if you
ssh into your mac this setting will not be noticed.

<P>
will start fontforge looking at the fonts you specify on the command line.
It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps fonts (type 0 fonts based
on a type 1 dictionary) as well as truetype fonts, open type fonts and many
other formats.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <KBD><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>fontforge -new</KBD>

<P>
will cause fontforge to create a new font (in iso-8859-1 encoding)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <KBD><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>fontforge</KBD>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse till you've found
a font file (or have created a new one).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <KBD><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>fontforge -script script.pe fonts...</KBD>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This will invoke fontforge in a non-interactive mode, and have it run the
named script. Any further arguments on the command line will be passed as
arguments to the script and processed (or not) by it.
