    <LI>
      31-August-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The mac fix for 25-Aug wasn't quite enough.
	<LI>
	  I used to maintain a hidden value of the os2 linegap. This didn't change
	  when users set linegap with font info, leaving users annoyed.
	<LI>
	  It used to be that both the Hint-&gt;Add Hint and Hint-&gt;Create Hint commands
	  would destroy all hint masks. Now we update those hint masks appropriately.
	<LI>
	  The "Original" encoding was broken, and reencoding to it gaves us 256 blank
	  glyphs before glyph0. Sigh.
	<LI>
	  The CodeRange bit for symbol doesn't mean the font contains any standard
	  set of "symbol" glyphs, but rather either that it has a 3,0 cmap sub-table,
	  or that there are glyphs mapped to 0xf000-0xf0ff in the 3,1 (unicode) sub-table.
	  <P>
	  Setting this bit should give you a symbol encoding as well as all the other
	  encodings you've set bits for. It doesn't work under windows. It doesn't
	  work. TrueType fonts do not provide a symbol encoding, while 'CFF ' fonts
	  only provide a symbol encoding. But hey, let's support it anyway!
	  <P>
	  change View-&gt;Goto to know about this range as MS Symbol.
	<LI>
	  Importing an eps file (or pasting the x clipboard) made use of an uninitialized
	  variable. (introduced 7-Aug)
	<LI>
	  Cleanup pasting references from one font to another (gave some very strange
	  results when pasting refs with no unicode encodings).
      </UL>
    <LI>
      25-August-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Recode the mac resource fork routines so that they no longer use the FSSpec
	  structure. 10.4 complains about it.
	<LI>
	  Bug in mm font charstring generation.
	<LI>
	  If a font contained mac feature setting names, then when ff generated it,
	  ff would produce duplicate entries in the 'name' table for these guys. One
	  for the name in the font itself, and one for the name ff thought that feature
	  setting should have.
	<LI>
	  Nobody else puts apple unicode names into the 'name' table so I probably
	  should not either. Adobe says one should not. Apple's website implies one
	  should -- but Apple doesn't and its ttf website is not very accurate.
	<LI>
	  When ff generated a ttf/otf font with applemode set and opentype off then
	  the font would have version 'true'. Which means windows would reject it.
	  That's probably not a good idea given that this situation is default on the
	  mac -- even if we don't have a GSUB/GPOS table we should at least let the
	  glyphs show on windows.
	  <P>
	  On the other hand some people might want to make fonts that only work on
	  macs. So add a configure flag.
	<LI>
	  ff couldn't undo changing the lig carets (if it weren't compiled for multilayer)
	<LI>
	  Copying a pairwise positioning left memory in a bad state.
	<LI>
	  Coalesce all lookups with the same feature &amp; script lang. This makes
	  ATM happy about kerning on windows.
	<LI>
	  When rasterizing a multilayer font we would sometimes get warnings from the
	  stroker about how the stroke self-intersected. Get rid of those warnings.
	<LI>
	  Pasting from a multilayered font into a normal one crashed
	<LI>
	  If an order2 font were turned into a PS font, then characters with hint conflicts
	  got no hints.
	<LI>
	  Makers of fonts on the mac often use out of bound GIDs as flags in contextual
	  su bstitutions. What I have seen is that one sub-table will insert such a
	  "glyph" w hen a match is found, and then the next sub table will remove the
	  flag, and perf orm subsequent transformations. This is important on the mac
	  because there is a limited number of substitutions that can happen once a
	  match is found, but if a match is found at the start (ie. the match being
	  some magic marker glyph) then u nlimited substitutions are available. When
	  ff first stumbled on these fonts it crashed, then it treated a gid&gt;glyph_cn
	  t as an error (and so it ignored the substitution). I've just put in code
	  that c reates dummy glyphs for all these bizarre GIDs so (I hope) the font
	  will work af ter passing through ff (only there will be some real blank glyphs
	  at the end of the font rather than vaper-ware glyphs).
	<LI>
	  The Active Hints pane (of Point Info) didn't always work if a glyph had more
	  than one contour.
	<LI>
	  Be more canny in the use of subroutines for references in type1/2 output.
	<LI>
	  When generating contextual lookups, ff did not set the lookup count between
	  gpos and gsub. So if a font had both contextual gpos &amp; gsub elements
	  ff got confused.
	<LI>
	  The code for cff encodings (ie. in bare cff non-cid fonts) didn't handle
	  multiply encoded glyphs
	<LI>
	  Change the default color of the prev control point (so it's easier for me
	  to see)
      </UL>
    <LI>
      11-August-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The configure script did not find libfreetype when it lived (solely) in
	  /usr/X11R6/libs
	<LI>
	  On the Mac, menus incorrectly suggested using Cmd rather than Ctl. (Cmd used
	  to work on earlier versions of the X server, but now it is snagged by the
	  X11 menubar itself.)
	<LI>
	  ff uses the Alt/Meta key to alter the behavior of some tools (magnify, ruler,
	  pointer, pencil, etc.) in the editing windows. This doesn't work well on
	  the mac. First there is no real Alt/Meta key. If we contemplate using Option
	  or Command it will generally already be used to turn the single button mouse
	  into a three button mouse (Option - mouse =&gt; button 2, Command - mouse
	  =&gt; button 3). So instead use the CapsLock key.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      9-August-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The big5 encoding stopped at 64000, which confused routines which expected
	  unencoded glyphs to start at 65536.
	<LI>
	  We would crash when reencoding a font with enough unencoded alternate unicode
	  code points.
	<LI>
	  The code for creating an 8/16 cmap subtable didn't work.
	<LI>
	  ff would crash if it had two windows open on the same font and one got reencoded
	<LI>
	  Didn't set the length of the format4 'cmap' sub-table, so the offset to the
	  format12 (32bit unicode) table was wrong.
	<LI>
	  ttfcopyfile can complain about a ttf table offset being wrong. Give it the
	  info so that it will now tell us which table has the wrong offset.
	<LI>
	  Uninitialized variable in metricsview when creating a popup window.
	<LI>
	  Redo the ttfnames pane of the font info dlg. Now show the names as an editable
	  list.
	<LI>
	  Histogram dlg still used wrong encodings for selected glyphs when historgrams
	  invoked from Hints menu.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      7-August-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  SelectIf failed when passed an encoding which was out of bounds
	<LI>
	  Added a new scripting command: ToString
	<LI>
	  Using the X clipboard to paste a glyph into a glyph that contained stuff
	  caused a crash.
	<LI>
	  Using the X clipboard to paste a glyph with references or with multilayer
	  did no t work.
	<LI>
	  None of ttf, otf nor svg got multiply encoded glyphs output properly.
	<LI>
	  FF screwed up memory when creating ligatures from an svg font.
	<LI>
	  Merge fonts was writing to bad memory.
	<LI>
	  FF was confused by a strange MM font
	<LI>
	  FindExistingSlot should understand altuni.
	<LI>
	  Font View didn't display current unicode of multiply encoded glyphs. (same
	  for popups).
	<LI>
	  Still having problems generating type1 code for complicated reference glyphs.
	<LI>
	  Retain knowlege of multiple unicode encodings for some glyphs. Used when
	  a glyph has multiple encodings and is reencoded.
	<LI>
	  Add back an option to compact an encoding. It's not the same as the old compact
	  which kept track of the former encoding. This just compacts, user must explicitly
	  reencode.
	<LI>
	  Force encoding didn't work if the new encoding had more slots than the old.
	<LI>
	  FF also failed to parse glyph based contextual lookups properly
      </UL>
    <LI>
      3-August-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  FF failed to parse class based contextual lookups properly (contextual chaining
	  lookups were ok)
      </UL>
    <LI>
      2-August-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><BIG>The OS/2 ulCodeRanges field has been broken
	  for a long time, and has failed to mark the presence of any latin code
	  pages.</BIG></STRONG></FONT>
	<LI>
	  The ulCodeRanges field never set Vietnamese, TradChinese, Mac nor PC OEM
	<LI>
	  FF did not support EUC-CN, ISO-2022-CN, ISO=2022-KR iconv encodings properly.
	<LI>
	  Work around a bug in iconv's support for CP1258
	<LI>
	  Put some code in to warn users about unknown language/locales in the ttf
	  'name' table.
	<LI>
	  Enter some new language/locale codes for ms.
	<LI>
	  Crash when moving the end of an open path in an order2 font.
	<LI>
	  If one loaded an encoding specified by codepoint and then cancelled the dlg
	  which asked for a name for that encoding, then ff would crash.
	<LI>
	  Don't use Adobe's glyphnames when they are obviously wrong (use uni???? instead)
	<LI>
	  Add (better) support for the new dotlessj
	<LI>
	  Put a check into the context chain dlg to make sure that people don't add
	  sequence/lookup pairs where the sequence number is too big.
	<LI>
	  Make class be the default format for contextual/chaining substitutions rather
	  than coverage tables.
	<LI>
	  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><BIG>The format of the LineBreak.txt file changed
	  with Unicode 4.1, so all the line break info is wrong (essentially lines
	  never broke in text fields).</BIG></STRONG></FONT>
	<LI>
	  Reference to bad memory when creating a popup in combinations list.
	<LI>
	  Still problems in the 'name' table when Mac &amp; Mac Unicode strings don't
	  match.
	<LI>
	  Use of the X clipboard for transfering glyphs resulted in a crash
	<LI>
	  When generating an old-style 'kern' table (either OpenType nor Apple modes
	  set) decompose all kerning classes into kern pairs as we do for AFM files.
	<LI>
	  Scripting didn't have a way to generate a font with neither Apple nor OpenType
	  tables. Add one.
	<LI>
	  Oops. wrong default extension for otb fonts from scripts.
	<LI>
	  Fix some potential crashes where loading font types left a new field unset.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      28-July-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><BIG>Redesigned the way encodings are handled.
	  From the user's perspective Encodings are no longer controlled by FontInfo,
	  but via an encoding menu.</BIG></STRONG></FONT>
	<LI>
	  If we create a bitmap strike in an empty font then change the fontview to
	  look at the strike.
	<LI>
	  The SetWidth command of FontView produced garbage defaults for empty fonts
	<LI>
	  Don't set the hinting needed bit on: bitmap only fonts, multilayered fonts,
	  stroked fonts nor quadratic fonts.
	<LI>
	  Fix some problems with the generated names in File-&gt;Generate multiple
	<LI>
	  The Save command failed to reset the font window's title (so it still looked
	  modified)
	<LI>
	  The enabled state of Encoding-&gt;Detach Glyphs was wrong
	<LI>
	  FF still didn't allow two ligatures to be created for the same glyph (ie.
	  it complained if you tried to make both "f + f + i =&gt; ffi" and "ff + i
	  =&gt; ffi"
	<LI>
	  Added a TypeOf command to scripting
	<LI>
	  Added a GetPosSub command to scripting.
	<LI>
	  Werner says negative widths and depths be set to 0 in tfm files.
	<LI>
	  FontForge was generating an incorrect warning message. If a 'name' table
	  contains a duplicate entry for a given platform/specific/language/id that's
	  an error in the font. But ff conflated mac names with window names and so
	  was only checking language/id. So if the mac windows names were different
	  (which is probably a bad design idea, but not an error) ff said it was wrong.
	  It can also be caused by using a character in the string which is not in
	  the Mac Encoding for that language.
	<LI>
	  Don't set "Hinting needed" flag in bitmap only fonts.
	<LI>
	  AutoHint had a crash if there were open contours in a glyph being hinted.
	<LI>
	  Add a couple of browsers to the list to check by default.
	<LI>
	  Using the kerning pair closeup dlg to create a new kerning pair caused a
	  crash (eventually).
	<LI>
	  When saving a block of ttf bitmap glyphs all with about the same metrics,
	<LI>
	  Kern pairs were not scaled to emsize when loading from an afm file.
	<LI>
	  Add a series of new selection commands, to the font view and to scripting:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      SelectChangedGlyphs
	    <LI>
	      SelectHintingNeeded
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  (just to scripting)
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      SelectSingletons
	    <LI>
	      SelectMoreSingletons
	    <LI>
	      SelectFewerSingletons
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Revert Glyph didn't work. One bug caused by multilayer, one caused by encoding
	  changes, and one really old one.
	<LI>
	  GetFontNames returned an uninitialized value on bad ttf files.
	<LI>
	  Add some new scripting commands to access the TeX per-glyph fields.
	<LI>
	  Werner suggested some improvements to tfm output.
	<LI>
	  Cleanup behavior of generating ttf bitmaps in a script.
	<LI>
	  I was attaching script/langs to lookups when parsing GPOS/GSUB. That wasn't
	  good enough. Each sub-table and have it's own set, so attach script/langs
	  to subtables as well. Still a flaw in that sub-tables could be referenced
	  through severel extension sub-tables or directly and I don't unravel that
	  complexity until too late.
	<LI>
	  ATM which handles some kerning for otf fonts for Word, does not handle 'kern'
	  features where the feature contains more than one lookup. So whenever we
	  have a feature with multiple lookups try to compress them into one lookup
	  with multiple sub-tables.
	<LI>
	  Transform (in fontview) and Scale To Em do not scale the vertical advance.
	<LI>
	  We didn't test the right thing when deciding where a subroutine containing
	  refs began.
	<LI>
	  Remove Undoes was broken by the encoding changes.
	<LI>
	  When saving multiple, make sure we don't get extraneous kerns. (to glyphs
	  not in the current sub-font).
	<LI>
	  Make sure the blue lines (marking hints needing to be updated) get cleared
	  properly.
	<LI>
	  Some display problems in the SameGlyphAs command.
	<LI>
	  The Apply Substitutions code did not consider the possibility of loops:<BR>
	  a-&gt;b-&gt;c-&gt;d-&gt;a
	<LI>
	  Werner suggests indicating multi-layer in the version string.
	<LI>
	  Mark to Mark anchor classes should allow each mark glyph also to contain
	  a base mark entry.
	<LI>
	  Give unicode name data (in grey) for dotted names. (ie for A.super give unicode
	  name data for "A", but in grey so it stands out as modified).
	<LI>
	  Add scripting routines to detach glyphs from the encoding and to remove them
	  from the font.
	<LI>
	  FF produced some very strange 'gasp' tables... depending on the bitmap fonts
	  in the sfd and not on the bitmaps in the output ttf for one thing.
	<LI>
	  Werner wants an Invert Selection command.
	<LI>
	  The position of Coptic and Glagolithic has been shifted in Unicode 4.1 (shifted
	  from some earlier proposal).
	<LI>
	  Patch by KANOU, ttc files were broken.
	<LI>
	  Some english language strings in the ttfnames pane of fontinfo where sort
	  of bound to equivalent fields in the names pane. Make this clearer, and
	  consistent.
	<LI>
	  Werner thinks my error messages for scripts should be improved.
	<LI>
	  Add a check in case sfd files contain unreasonable values for pixelsize,
	  etc.
	<LI>
	  Werner suggests a --dry &lt;scriptfile&gt; argument which does syntax checking
	  without actually executing the script. I think it is trivial.
	<LI>
	  Werner points out that the DSC Version comment has a very specific syntax:<BR>
	  %%Version: &lt;version&gt; &lt;revision&gt;<BR>
	  &lt;version&gt; is a real, &lt;revision&gt; is a uint. So we can't use the
	  font's version string here (which might be anything). Instead we now generate
	  a version comment<BR>
	  %Version: &lt;string&gt;<BR>
	  rather than a DSC Comment.
	<LI>
	  We used to assign a unicode value to ".notdef"s when reading ps encoding
	  file, if the encoding was in the region of control chars (so location 1 would
	  get uni0001, while location 65 would get -1). Seems inconsistent.
	<LI>
	  Oops. I failed to provide a mechanism to add other iconv encoding names into
	  my menu.
	<LI>
	  Code to support group display.
	<LI>
	  Was not reading ps encoding files properly.
	<LI>
	  Remove encoding should always be available.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      19-July-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Extend to Unicode 4.1
	<LI>
	  Change to configuration system to allow relative pathspecs for
	  --with-freetype-src didn't work.
	<LI>
	  Context chain dlg had problems with empty patterns (no terminal NUL in empty
	  string used to represent them)
	<LI>
	  The [EditData] button in contextual fontinfo pane was disabled due to reasons
	  which are no longer valid..
	<LI>
	  Transforming by a negative scale factor screwed up the hints.
	<LI>
	  Add move up/down buttons to the kerning class dlg (class lists area) Use
	  the selection from the class lists to highlight offsets.
	<LI>
	  Print sample did not handle kerning by classes.
	<LI>
	  When we had: a glyph which contained refs where that glyph was itself used
	  as a reference in another glyph and all glyphs (except the last) lived in
	  subroutines then we got multiple declarations of hints and the middle glyph
	  was translated from where it should have been.
	<LI>
	  When changing lists they should not scroll back to the beginning.
	<LI>
	  Various fixes regarding hints: changing hints should set the char changed
	  flag changing a glyph should mark all glyphs that refer to it as having out
	  of date hints display out of date hints in font view. hints weren't being
	  preserved (and should have been) in charview in Paste and transform.
	<LI>
	  Apply Substitutions was badly broken when ff compiled with multilayer.
	<LI>
	  Kern Pair dlg looked at garbage memory when it closed (and crashed sometimes).
	<LI>
	  ff decides whether to add a 'gasp' table to a font based on whether the font
	  has instructions or not. ff's own ttf fonts contain instructions in .notdef
	  but nowhere else, so ignore .notdef when making this check.
	<LI>
	  One more attempt to rule out absurd results in simplify().
	<LI>
	  if the lsb/rsb dlg was given a negative value it complained about negative
	  widths. (whether the width would have been negative or not).
	<LI>
	  $italicangle has been broken since I added reals to scripting.
	<LI>
	  The kernclass dialog did not handle deleted classes properly.
	<LI>
	  Add ability to undo hints.
	<LI>
	  Once again starting a browser on windows is broken.
	<LI>
	  We didn't do a bounds check when indexing into the names array of an encoding
	  (when building a character from scratch). If the index was huge the result
	  was garbage, generally leading to a crash sometime thereafter.
	<LI>
	  An open path consisting of a single point caused replace with reference to
	  crash.
	<LI>
	  Generating a postscript resource font on the mac from a script did not work.
	<LI>
	  Werner points out that afm files generated by FontForge still claim to have
	  been made by pfaedit. Oops.
	<LI>
	  Didn't parse user defined encodings properly and often omitted the first
	  glyph.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      24-June-2005
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Improvements in the way type42 fonts where handled in printing.
	<LI>
	  Fix a crash when parsing mangled cff files
	<LI>
	  Marvelous triple bug:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Adobe's Tech Note 5176 (cff format) says that a private dict is required.
	      They mean it's required in a type1 font.
	    <LI>
	      Because of this I put a null private dict entry into my cid cff fonts.
	    <LI>
	      ghostview finds the null private dict entry and tries to read data from it
	      even though it is of 0 length.
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Add postscript code necessary for loading a cff font to my cff font output.
	<LI>
	  Fix some uninitialized variables in the display dlg.
	<LI>
	  We didn't get DSC pages properly when printing a CID keyed font.
	<LI>
	  The default (notdef) glyph generated by my palm output routines was a little
	  wonky.
	<LI>
	  The rle image reader in my sfd routines had an off by one error causing it
	  to reject some images.
	<LI>
	  We used to munch memory when loading empty glyphs from mac NFNT resources.
	<LI>
	  It used to be that we didn't set the default background until the first font
	  view window was opened. This meant that if we loaded a grey scale bitmap
	  before opening a window (ie. from the command line) then that bitmap's clut
	  would be relative to white rather than the appropriate background.
	<LI>
	  Add some code to protect against badly generated bitmap strikes in sfnts.
	<LI>
	  vhea &amp; vmtx tables were generally wrong in otf fonts (unless the last
	  full vmetric happened to be the last full hmetric). Also fix problems with
	  cid hmtx output.
	<LI>
	  The sfd reader looked in the wrong place for sli information in cid keyed
	  fonts.
	<LI>
	  Damn. Default output (for stdout) encoding never gets initialized when in
	  a script.
	<LI>
	  I realized a few months ago that there is a difference between encodings
	  based on names and encoding based on unicode codepoints. Unfortunately I
	  was only saving encodings as though they were based on names (generating
	  default names if necessary). This patch retains the distinction even when
	  encodings are saved to the preferences folder.
	<LI>
	  AddAccent behaved differently when passed a glyphname and a unicode code
	  point. In the first case it used the glyph specified. In the second it performed
	  an arcane search which would not always use the specified glyph (left over
	  from the days when it was important to use a glyph in Adobe Standard so you
	  could do a seac).
	<LI>
	  When debugging composite glyphs ff failed to notice when we switched from
	  one glyph to another and so failed to reset the instruction list to those
	  of the new glyph.
	<LI>
	  Problem with cubic to quadratic spline approximation. Fixed by a more careful
	  comparison between original and resulting spline.
	<LI>
	  Kerning (and Anchor positioning) didn't work when printing to pdf.
	<LI>
	  Won-kyu Park points out that ff's internal utf7 parser (deep in the guts
	  of sfd.c) only parses utf7 strings as produced by ff. He took a utf7 string
	  produced by python and inserted it and ff could not read it. He provides

	  In the character view the Remove Overlap (and Intersect and Find Intersections)
	  now only work on selected contours, or, if no contours are selected then
	  on all contours. This change makes these commands consistant with most other
	  commands in the character view, but it is a change from past behavior.
	<LI>
	  The Import scripting command has been extended to give the user control over
	  the stroking flags (correct direction, remove overlap, handle erasers). And
	  the background flag has been extended a bit to apply to other things than

	<LI>
	  The AMS (American Mathematical Society) has their own interpretation of the
	  public use area. FF now understands their glyph names as alternates for those
	  glyphs, and has an AMS interpretation (under FontInfo-&gt;Encoding) that
	  will make ff use those names in new fonts.
	<LI>
	  Many of code points in the AMS PUA are reencodings of other glyphs. FontForge
	  will automatically generate these reencodings for you.
	<LI>
	  The AMS also describes how some TeX glyph names map to unicode. So include
	  those names in our alternate list too (so we can map them correctly, not
	  as a way of encouraging people to use them).
	<LI>
	  Both the AMS defn. of the PUA and the Big5 defn. map characters which are

	  from the PUA to their proper unicode slot in higher planes.

	  Piska keeps complaining about the way ff handles 0 width strokes. He wants

	  as the thinnest line possible (not clear what this should mean in ff, I interpret
	  it as a 1em-unit stroke). But METAPOST uses a 0 width stroke in cases where
	  it wants no stroking (with a fill) so in the special case of a fill with

	  Use a different approach to approximating a set of points with fixed slopes
