/**
 * The server is modeled on "Clone server Model Five" from the zguide.
 * https://github.com/imatix/zguide
 *
 * The Model numbers build on each other and the below is a breif overview
 * of the chain:
 * 
 * 5 uses a reactor for handling events
 * 4 has subtrees and allows clients to get at each tree separately
 * 3 takes updates from clients and sends them out to all through
 *   the publisher
 * 2 allows an out of band snapshot to be obtained from the server
 *   by a client
 * 1 is the initial desgin but requires all clients to be started
 *   before the server
 *
 * The next model up uses two servers to allow one to crash without
 * effecting the session. As the server is meant to be a very simple
 * process that maintains the hash of state and talks to clients I am
 * starting with only one server process to make things much simpler.
 *
 * Any complex computation can be done by the server spawning a child
 * process which knows where the server is at and what version or
 * perform it's action on. For example, to collapse the tree of a
 * collab session back so that everything less than sequence number
 * "X" is collapsed into an SFD with number X+1, that slot can be
 * reserved by the server and a subprocess created to collapse the
 * data and push back the new SFD to the server. The complex collapse
 * process is thus handled out of process which insulates this single
 * server from crashing due to issues in processing.
 *
 * Having the server itself out as a separate process allows the local
 * FontForge "server" process itself to crash without breaking the
 * collaboration session. The local fontforge can be restarted and
 * attach to the local server to get the whole state back.
