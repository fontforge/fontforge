    Writing scripts to change fonts in FontForge
  </H1>
  <P>
  FontForge includes two interpreters so you can write scripts to modify fonts.
  One of these interpreters is <A HREF="python.html">python</A>, one is a legacy
  language I came up with. FontForge may be configured with either or both
  of these. If configured with both then fontforge will make a guess at which
  to use based on the script file's extension ("py" means use the python
  interpreter, "ff" or "pe" means use the old interpreter)

  <P>
  If you start fontforge with a script on the command line it will not put
  up any windows and it will exit when the script is done. The script can be
  in a file, or just a string presented as an argument. You may need to specify
  which interpreter to use with the -lang argument.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>$ fontforge -script scriptfile.pe {arguments}
$ fontforge -c "script-string" {arguments}
$ fontforge -lang={ff|py} -c "script-string"
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  FontForge can also be used as an interpreter to which the shell will
  automatically pass scripts. If you a mark your script files as executable<BR>
  <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ chmod +x scriptfile.pe</CODE><BR>
  and begin each one with the line<BR>
  <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; #!/usr/local/bin/fontforge</CODE><BR>
  (or wherever fontforge happens to reside on your system) then you can invoke
  the script just by typing<BR>
  <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ scriptfile.pe {fontnames}</CODE>
  <P>
  If you wish FontForge to read a script from stdin then you can use "-" as
  a "filename" for stdin. (If you build FontForge without X11 then fontforge
  will attempt to read a script file from <CODE>stdin</CODE> if none is given
  on the command line.)
  <P>
  You can also start a script from within FontForge with
  <CODE>File-&gt;Execute Script</CODE>, and you can use the Preference Dlg
  to define a set of frequently used scripts which can be invoked directly
  by menu.
  <P>
  The scripting language provides access to much of the functionality found
  in the font view's menus. It does not currently (and probably never will)
  provide access to everything. (If you find a lack let me know, I may put
  it in for you). It does not provide commands for building up a glyph out
  of splines, instead it allows you to do high level modifications to glyphs.
  <P>
  If you set the environment variable <CODE>FONTFORGE_VERBOSE</CODE> (it doesn't
  need a value, just needs to be set) then FontForge will print scripts to
  stdout as it executes them.
  <P>
  You may set the environment variable <CODE>FONTFORGE_LANGUAGE</CODE> to either
  "py" (for python) or "ff" or "pe" (for native scripting) as another way to
  determne what interpreter to use.

  <P>
  The syntax is rather like a mixture of C and shell commands. Every file
  corresponds to a procedure. As in a shell script arguments passed to the
  file are identified as $1, $2, ... $n. $0 is the file name itself. $argc
  gives the number of arguments. $argv[&lt;expr&gt;] provides array access
  to the arguments.
  <P>
  Terms can be
  <UL>
    <LI>
      A variable name (like "$1" or "i" or "@fontvar" or "_global")<BR>
      The scope of the variable depends on the initial character of its name.
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  A '$' signifies that it is a built-in variable. The user cannot create any
	  new variables beginning with '$'. Some, but not all, of these may be assigned
	  to.
	<LI>
	  A '_' signifies that the variable is global, it is always available. You
	  can use these to store context across different script files (or to access
	  data within nested script files).
	<LI>
	  A '@' signifies that the variable is associated with the font. Any two scripts
	  looking at the same font will have access to the same variables.
	<LI>
	  A variable which begins with a letter is a local variable. It is only meaningful
	  within the current script file. Nested script files may have different variables
	  with the same names.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      an integer expressed in decimal, hex or octal
    <LI>
      a unicode code point (which has a prefix of "0u" or "0U" and is followed
      by a string of hex digits. This is only used by the select command.
    <LI>
      a real number (in "C" locale format -- "." as the decimal point character)
    <LI>
      A string which may be enclosed in either double or single quotes. String
      tokens are limited to 256 bytes. "\n" can be used to represent a newline
      character. (If you need longer strings use the concatenation operator).
    <LI>
      a procedure to call or file to invoke.
    <LI>
      an expression within parentheses
    <LI>
      a series of expressions (separated by commas) within brackets, as <CODE>[1,
      2, 3, 5, 8]</CODE>, used to create an array.
  </UL>
  <P>
  There are three different comments supported:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      Starting with a "#" character and proceeding to end of line
    <LI>
      Starting with "//" and proceeding to end of line
    <LI>
      Starting with "/*" and proceeding to "*/"
  </UL>
  <P>
  <A NAME="Expressions">Expressions</A> are similar to those in C, a few operators
  have been omitted, a few added from shell scripts. Operator precedence has
  been simplified slightly. So operators (and their precedences) are:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      unary operators (+, -, !, ~, ++ (prefix and postfix), --(prefix and postfix),
      () (procedure call), [] (array index), :h, :t, :r, :e<BR>
      Most of these are as expected in C, the last four are borrowed from shell
      scripts and are applied to strings
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  :h gives the head (directory) of a pathspec
	<LI>
	  :t gives the tail (filename) of a pathspec
	<LI>
	  :r gives the pathspec without the extension (if any)
	<LI>
	  :e gives the extension
      </UL>
    <LI>
      *, /, % (binary multiplicative operators)
    <LI>
      +, - (binary arithmetic operators)<BR>
      If the first operand of + is a string then + will be treated as concatenation
      rather than addition. If the second operand is a number it will be converted
      to a string (decimal representation) and then concatenated. If the first
      operand of + is an array then + will do array concatenation -- if the second
      argment is also an array the two will be concatenated ([1,2] + [3,4] yields
      [1,2,3,4], while [1,2] + 3 yields [1,2,3]). Otherwise these are the normal
      arithmetric operations.
    <LI>
      ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;= (comparison operators, may be applied to
      either two integers or two strings)
    <LI>
      &amp;&amp;, &amp; (logical and, bitwise and. (logical and will do short circuit
      evaluation))
    <LI>
      ||, |, ^ (logical or, bitwise or, bitwise exclusive or (logical or will do
      short circuit evaluation))
    <LI>
      =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= (assignment operators as in C. The += will act as
      concatenation if the first operand is a string.)
  </UL>
  <P>
  Note there is no comma operator, and no "?:" operator. The precedence of
  "and" and "or" has been simplified, as has that of the assignment operators.
  <P>
  Procedure calls may be applied either to a name token, or to a string. If
  the name or string is recognized as one of FontForge's internal procedures
  it will be executed, otherwise it will be assumed to be a filename containing
  another fontforge script file, this file will be invoked (since filenames
  can contain characters not legal in name tokens it is important to allow
  general strings to specify filenames). If the procedure name does not contain
  a directory then it is assumed to be in the same directory as the current
  script file.  As a convenience, it is not necessary to include the
  script's extension if it is either ".ff" or ".pe".  At most 25 arguments can be
  passed to a procedure.
  <P>
  Arrays are passed by reference, strings and integers are passed by value.
  <P>
  Variables may be created by assigning a value to them (only with the "="),
  so:<BR>
  <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; i=3</CODE><BR>
  could be used to define "i" as a variable. Variables are limited in scope
  to the current file, they will not be inherited by called procedures.
  <P>
  A statement may be
  <UL>
    <LI>
      an expression
    <LI>
      <CODE>if ( expression )<BR>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
      {elseif ( expression )<BR>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; statements}<BR>
      [else<BR>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; statements]<BR>
      endif</CODE>
    <LI>
      <CODE>while ( expression )<BR>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
      endloop</CODE>
    <LI>
      <CODE>foreach<BR>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; statements<BR>
      endloop</CODE>
    <LI>
      <CODE>break</CODE>
    <LI>
      <CODE>return [ expression ]</CODE>
    <LI>
      <CODE>shift</CODE>
  </UL>
  <P>
  As with C, non-zero expressions are defined to be true.<BR>
  A return statement may be followed by a return value (the expression) or
  a procedure may return nothing (void).<BR>
  The shift statement is stolen from shell scripts and shifts all arguments
  down by one. (argument 0, the name of the script file, remains unchanged.<BR>
  The foreach statement requires that there be a current font. It executes
  the statements once for each glyph in the selection. Within the statements
  only one glyph at a time will be selected. After execution the selection
  will be restored to what it was initially. (Caveat: Don't reencode the font
  within a foreach statement).<BR>
  Statements are terminated either by a new line (you can break up long lines
  with backslash newline) or a semicolon.
  <P>
  Trivial example:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>i=0;	#semicolon is not needed here, but it's ok
while ( i&lt;3 )
   if ( i==1 /* pointless comment */ )
	Print( "Got to one" )	// Another comment
   endif
   ++i
endloop
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  FontForge maintains the concept of a "current font"-- almost all commands
  refer only to the current font (and require that there be a font). If you
  start a script with File-&gt;Execute Script, the font you were editing will
  be current, otherwise there will be no initial current font. The Open(),
  New() and Close() commands all change the current font. FontForge also maintains
  a list of all fonts that are currently open. This list is in no particular
  order. The list starts with $firstfont.
  <P>
  Similarly when working with cid keyed fonts, FontForge works in the "current
  sub font", and most commands refer to this font. The CIDChangeSubFont() command
  can alter that.
  <P>
  All builtin <A NAME="variables">variables</A> begin with "$", you may not
  create any variables that start with "$" yourself (though you may assign
  to (some) already existing ones)

    <LI>
      <CODE>$order </CODE>returns an integer containing either 2 (for truetype

      item (to set it use
      <CODE><A HREF="scripting-alpha.html#SetPref">SetPref</A></CODE>)
  </UL>
  <P>
  The following example will perform an action on all loaded fonts:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <PRE>file = $firstfont
while ( file != "" )
   Open(file)

   file = $nextfont
endloop

    The <A NAME="Execute">Execute</A> Script dialog
  </H2>
  <P>
  This dialog allows you to type a script directly in to FontForge and then
  run it. Of course the most common case is that you'll have a script file
  somewhere that you want to execute, so there's a button [Call] down at the
  bottom of the dlg. Pressing [Call] will bring up a file picker dlg looking
  for files with the extension *.pe (you can change that by typing a wildcard
  sequence and pressing the [Filter] button). After you have selected your
  script the appropriate text to text to invoke it will be placed in the text
  area.
  <P>
  The current font of the script will be set to whatever font you invoked it
  from (in python this is <CODE>fontforge.activeFontInUI()</CODE>).
  <P>
  Note that if you try to print from a script the output will go to stdout.
  If you have invoked fontforge from a window manager's menu stdout will often
  be bound to /dev/null and not useful. Try starting fontforge from the command
  line instead.
  <H2>
    The Scripts <A NAME="menu">Menu</A>
  </H2>
  <P>
  You can use the preference dialog to create a list of frequently used scripts.
  Invoke <A HREF="prefs.html#scripts">File-&gt;Preferences</A> and select the
  Scripts tag. In this dialog are ten possible entries, each one should have
  a name (to be displayed in the menu) and an associated script file to be
  run.
  <P>
  After you have set up your preferences you can invoke scripts from the font
  view, either directly from the menu (File-&gt;Scripts-&gt;&lt;your name&gt;)
  or by a hot key. The first script you added will be invoked by Cnt-Alt-1,
  then second by Cnt-Alt-2, and the tenth by Cnt-Alt-0.
  <P>
  The current font of the script will be set to whatever font you invoked it
  from.
