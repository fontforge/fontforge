# Installing FontForge from Git Source Code

## Doing It By Hand

Clone a copy of the Github source repository:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/src/github.com/fontforge;
cd ~/src/github.com/fontforge;
git clone https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge.git;
```

Install all your typical build tools, build dependencies and runtime dependencies - all the packages that allow you to build of software from source code.
The exact method to do this depends on your OS distribution.
You can see a list of the dependencies for Debian in the [debian/control](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/blob/master/debian/control) file, or to generate a list on Debian-like systems with `aptitude` installed, run `sudo ./debian/deb-build-dep`

To download all dependencies on Debian Jessie, run:

```sh
sudo apt-get install autotools-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff5-dev libpng-dev libgif-dev libxt-dev libfreetype6-dev autoconf automake libtool libltdl7-dev libxml2-dev libuninameslist-dev libspiro-dev python-dev libpango1.0-dev libcairo2-dev chrpath
```

To download all dependencies on Ubuntu, run:

```sh
sudo apt-get install packaging-dev pkg-config python-dev libpango1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev libxml2-dev giflib-dbg libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev uthash-dev libspiro-dev build-essential automake flex bison;
```

Install the *unifont* package to get a full display of the reference glyphs.
[Unifont] (http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/unifont) includes glyphs for all Unicode codepoints, and FontForge will use it if it is installed.

```sh
sudo apt-get install unifont;
```

FontForge uses *[libspiro](http://github.com/fontforge/libspiro)* to simplify the drawing of curves.
Download and install the latest code like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/fontforge/libspiro.git
cd libspiro
autoreconf -i
automake --foreign -Wall
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..
```

Build *libuninameslist*

FontForge uses [libuninameslist] (http://github.com/fontforge/libuninameslist) to access attribute data about each Unicode code point.

Download the code:

```
git clone https://github.com/fontforge/libuninameslist.git
```

Run the following commands in sequence (that is, wait for each one to complete before running the next):

```
cd libuninameslist
autoreconf -i
automake --foreign
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..
```

Now run the build and installation scripts, and ensure you can open shared object files:

```sh
cd fontforge;
./bootstrap;
./configure;
make;
sudo make install;
sudo ldconfig;
```

**Attention, Designers Who Love TrueType Hinting:** 
You like to run `./configure` with the `--with-freetype-source` option. 
This option enables advanced features for debugging TrueType font hints, such as stepping through hinting instructions one by one.

## Common Problems

* If you can not install due to problems with Python, run ```./configure``` line like this (paths may vary):
```
PYTHON_CFLAGS="-I/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7" \
PYTHON_LIBS="-L/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/config" \
./configure \
--disable-programs \
--disable-native-scripting \
--without-x \
--without-cairo \
--without-giflib \
--without-libjpeg \
--without-libtiff \
--without-libpng \
--without-libspiro \
--without-libuninameslist \
--without-libunicodenames \
--without-iconv \
--without-libzmq \
--without-libreadline \
--enable-python-scripting \
--enable-python-extension;
```
Or try this:
```sh
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig/ \
PYTHON_CFLAGS="-I/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7" \
PYTHON_LIBS="-L/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/config" \
./configure;
```

* Problems with lack of libraries can be solved with Homebrew or similar systems:
```
brew install autoconf;
brew install automake;
brew install glib;
brew install pango;
```

* If `make` fails with `no such file or directory msgfmt` then with Homebrew run:
```
brew install gettext;
```
Then edit then your shell profile (eg, `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zprofile`) and add:
```
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin
```

##Â On Mac OS X with Homebrew

Homebrew no longer packages FontForge with a UI, but the release GUI app bundles are available from Cask. 
You can install FontForge from the current github source code using a package manager, such as MacPorts or Fink. 

Here is how to install FontForge without a UI:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
**Check everything's ok** (fix any issues before moving on)
```
brew doctor
```
**Install dependencies**
```
brew install python gettext libpng jpeg libtiff giflib cairo pango libspiro czmq fontconfig automake libtool pkg-config glib pango
```

**Install the latest release or build from source**  
Release:
```
brew install -v --debug --with-giflib --with-libspiro fontforge
```
Source:
```
brew install -v --debug --with-giflib --with-libspiro fontforge --HEAD
```

If this does not work, please [file an issue](When_Things_Go_Wrong_With_Fontforge_Itself)

To install the UI with Cask:

```
brew tap caskroom/cask; # Install cask
brew cask install fontforge; # Install fontforge
```
