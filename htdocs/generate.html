  <P>
  <IMG SRC="generate.png" WIDTH="414" HEIGHT="462" ALIGN="Right">This generates
  font files, both outline and bitmap. You may choose not to generate either,
  you may generate an afm file or a pfm file, you may select the type of postscript
  output, you may select which pixelsizes of bitmap to generate.
  <P>
  The outline types are:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      PostScript Type1 font, binary format (a .pfb file, this may be by most modern
      windowing systems)
    <LI>
      PostScript Type1 font, ascii format (a .pfa file, this is used by printers)
    <LI>
      PostScript Type1 font, macbinary format (a postscript font wrapped up in
      a set of mac resources wrapped up in a macbinary file, to be copied to a
      mac, unmacbinaried, and installed there)<BR>
      If you are on a mac then a resource fork will be generated directly, macbinary
      will not be used.
      <P>
      <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><BIG>NOTE:</BIG></STRONG></FONT> The mac will not
      recognize a PostScript font unless you also generate a bitmap font in NFNT
      format and place it in the same directory. If you haven't created any bitmap
      fonts yet, cancel this dlg and use
      <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Bitmaps">Element-&gt;Bitmaps Available</A> to generate
      a bitmap font, and then retry this dlg.
      <P>
      <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><BIG>NOTE:</BIG></STRONG></FONT> Apple implies
      that this format is depreciated and therefore it may not work in future versions.
    <LI>
      Multiple Master(A), generates a multiple master font in ascii format (same
      as .pfa)
    <LI>
      Multiple Master(B), generates a multiple master font in binary format (same
      as .pfb)
    <LI>
      Multiple PostScript Type 1 binary fonts (this is used to convert a large
      font with a two byte encoding into a series of smaller pfb (or pfa) files
      with 256 glyphs in each. You may be prompted for a file to specify the
      conversion. See the ttf2tfm man page for a description of these SUBFONT
      DEFINITION FILES. <A HREF="Big5.txt">Here is an example of what the file
      should look like</A>)
    <LI>
      PostScript Type3 font (a .pt3 font, this is also used by printers and is
      not encrypted)
    <LI>
      PostScript Type0 font, this is only available if you have a font encoded
      with Unicode or one of the CJK encodings. Type0 fonts can have up to 65536
      glyphs in them (as opposed to 256 for Type1s and Type3s).
    <LI>
      PostScript Type42 font (this is really a TrueType font wrapped up in PostScript)
    <LI>
      PostScript Type42 CID font
    <LI>
      PostScript CID font, this is only available if your font is a
      <A HREF="cidmenu.html">CID font</A>. This produces a font in the old Type1
      CID format. You probably want to use the OpenType CID format...
    <LI>
      PostScript CFF font, this is the format that lives inside the 'CFF ' table
      of an opentype font. It is a valid font format in its own right.
    <LI>
      True Type. The instructions (hinting) are probably not very good. No diagonal
      stems are hinted. Instructing is based on the hints used for postscript,
      with some additional work done for serifs, and some recognition that all
      glyphs of approximately the same height should have the same height at small
      pointsizes (equivalent to PostScript's BlueValues).
    <LI>
      True Type Symbol. Same as True Type, except it uses the 1 byte encoding given
      in the font. This is important on windows as symbol and dingbat encodings
      often include characters (in the range 0x80-0x9f) which aren't mapped in
      normal encodings. It is important on the Mac because I do not generate the
      correct encoding tables for any script other than MacRoman, so if you want
      a MacCyrillic font use this mode.
    <LI>
      True Type macbinary format, a truetype font wrapped up in a mac resource,
      wrapped up in a macbinary file. Designed to be used for a mac.<BR>
      If you are on a mac, then a file with a resource fork will be generated directly
      (macbinary will not be used).
    <LI>
      True Type dfont format, a truetype font wrapped up in a mac dfont (data fork
      resource file). Mac OS/X font.
    <LI>
      Open Type. Officially Open Type includes True Type, but Open Type True Type
      fonts are no different from plain True Type fonts, so they might as well
      just be called True Type. So by Open Type I mean Open Type with a CFF Postscript
      Type 2 font inside it.
    <LI>
      Open Type dfont format, an open type font wrapped up in a mac dfont (data
      fork resource file). Mac OS/X font.
    <LI>
      Open Type CID, This is only available if your font is a
      <A HREF="cidmenu.html">CID font</A>. It produces an OpenType CID-keyed font.
    <LI>
      <A HREF="#svg">SVG font</A>
    <LI>
      None
  </UL>
  <P>
  The bitmap types are:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      BDF -- The internal bitmap fonts will be saved in bdf format. You may only
      select sizes for which you have already generated fonts (you may output
      anti-aliased (greymap) fonts as well as bitmaps. A 12pixel high greymap font
      with 8 bits/pixel can be represented as 12@8).
    <LI>
      In TTF -- Store the bitmap fonts inside the ttf file (the exact format will
      depend on the settings of the Apple and OpenType bits in the Options dlg).
    <LI>
      In sfnt (dfont) -- Only available if no outline font is generated. Apple
      allows bitmaps to be stored within a truetype file (sfnt) even if there is
      no outline font. So this generates a ttf file that just contains bitmaps
      and wraps it up in a dfont.
    <LI>
      NFNT (MacBin) -- Converts the bitmap fonts into Macintosh NFNT resources
      and wraps them up in a mac binary file.<BR>
      NFNT (Resource) -- On a mac the NFNT font will be generated in a resource
      fork directly.
      <P>
      <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><BIG>NOTE:</BIG></STRONG></FONT> Mac OS/X appears
      not to support NFNT bitmaps (at least I can't get them to work).
      <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>However</STRONG></FONT>, the mac still needs at
      least one NFNT in order to find an type1 font. Even though the bitmap is
      required, it will not be used. Odd.
    <LI>
      Windows FON -- Windows resource based font format.
    <LI>
      Windows FNT -- Windows format, one bitmap font per file.
    <LI>
      OpenType Bitmap -- this is the new X11 bitmap format with bitmaps embedded
      in an sfnt wrapper (an opentype or truetype font) but with no outline data.
    <LI>
      Palm fonts -- support for <A HREF="palmfonts.html">various palm bitmap font
      formats.</A>
    <LI>
      PS Type3 Bitmap -- create a PostScript Type3 font which uses the imagemask
      operator to display each glyph's bitmap.
    <LI>
      None
  </UL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="GenerateOptions.png" WIDTH="323" HEIGHT="355" ALIGN="Right">The
  <A NAME="Options">options</A> dialog provides the following check boxes.
  Not all are enabled at all times.
  <UL>
    <LI>
      [] Round -- Round all coordinates to integral values. If this is not checked
      then Type1 fonts will be output with 2 decimal digits of precision, and Type2
      fonts with 16 binary digits (~4 decimal digits) when needed.
    <LI>
      [] Hints -- Include PostScript hints in the output file
    <LI>
      [] Flex Hints -- Include PostScript flex hints in the output file
    <LI>
      [] AFM -- Generate an adobe font metrics file (controls generation of .amfm
      files for multiple master fonts too)<BR>
      Note: Only 'liga' and 'rlig' ligatures will be output in the AFM file. If
      this is not what you want, use the
      <A HREF="scripting-alpha.html#ControlAfmLigatureOutput">ControlAfmLigatureOutput</A>
      scripting command.
    <LI>
      [] Composites in AFM -- the AFM format includes a mechanism for building
      composite glyphs out of components. It is roughly equivalent to the OpenType
      mark-to-base feature. Almost nobody uses these data, and they can increase
      the size of an AFM file enormously, but if you would like them check this
      box (if your font does not include any anchor classes, this will have no
      effect).
    <LI>
      [] PFM -- Generate a windows printer font metrics file
    <LI>
      [] <A NAME="TFM">TFM</A> -- Generate a TeX font metrics file (and a TeX enc
      encoding file) 
	<HR>
    <LI>
      [] Hints -- Include truetype hints in a truetype font. NOTE: This used to
      generate bad truetype instructions, now it merely inserts whatever truetype
      instructions are stored with the glyph. If these have been read from another
      truetype font they will probably be reasonable. If they have been generated
      with FontForge's AutoInstr menu command they will probably make your font
      uglier.
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  R C van Dalen's <A HREF="http://home.kabelfoon.nl/~slam/fonts/">truetype
	  hinting utilities may be helpful here.</A>
      </UL>
    <LI>
      [] PSNames -- Include the full 'post' (postscript name) table in the font
    <LI>
      [] <A NAME="AppleMode">Apple</A> -- Apple and MS/Adobe disagree on the format
      of a ttf font. This is annoying. Checking this box means the font will be
      generated according to Apple's desires, leaving it unchecked means according
      to MS/Adobe's desires. Currently this controls:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The bitmap tables (Apple calls it 'bdat', MS/Adobe 'EBDT'. The data in them
	  are the same)
	<LI>
	  The PostScript name in the 'name' table (Apple says there must be either
	  0 or 1 of them, MS/Adobe say any value other than 1)
	<LI>
	  Apple and MS/Adobe also differ on the way references (components) are scaled.
	  Luckily there is another way to disambiguate this case (and references are
	  rarely scaled anyway).
	<LI>
	  The GDEF, GPOS, GSUB and prop, lcar, kern, opbd, morx, feat tables. Apple
	  does not support GPOS/GSUB tables. MicroSoft still supports kern tables for
	  some fonts but requires GPOS for others.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      [] OpenType -- If this is checked the font will be generated with the tables
      used by OpenType. If both this and [] Apple are checked the font will have
      two sets of tables, Apple will look at one set, and everyone else will look
      at the other.
      (<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><BIG>CAVEAT</BIG></STRONG></FONT>: The above statement
      was true up to 10.4 ("Tiger") after 10.4, Apple will use OpenType tables
      if they are present and may ignore AAT tables. Unfortunately Apple doesn't
      implement all of OpenType so Apple's behavior may be
      <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>WRONG</STRONG></FONT>).
    <LI>
      [] Old style 'kern' -- If this is checked along with OpenType then both an
      OpenType 'GPOS' and an old style 'kern' table will be generated (assuming
      there are any kern pairs, of course). The OpenType mailing list considers
      this a bad idea (some applications may add the kerning values from both tables
      they say), but it may be helpful for applications which don't support 'GPOS'
      kerning.
    <LI>
      [] Save Comments -- I have added my own table
      ('<A HREF="non-standard.html#PfEd">PfEd</A>') in the truetype format in which
      I can store whatever data I want. Checking this box saves all the glyph comments
      into the output file.
    <LI>
      [] Save Colors -- Save the glyph colors in the
      '<A HREF="non-standard.html#PfEd">PfEd</A>' table as well.
    <LI>
      [] TeX -- Save TeX metrics in the '<A HREF="non-standard.html#TeX">TeX</A>
      ' table
    <LI>
      [] Output Glyph Map -- Output a file (with extension .g2n) mapping TrueType
      (OpenType) glyph IDs to glyphnames (and possibly to unicode values)
    <LI>
      [] Output OFM &amp; CFG -- Output metrics files for Omega
  </UL>
  <P>
  TTF (and Open Type) fonts are usually generated in Unicode encoding, there
  will also be a tiny macintosh encoding of MacRoman (and a macintosh copy
  of the unicode encoding) -- the exceptions are: symbol fonts will use the
  symbol encoding, KSC5601 and Wansung fonts will use Wansung, Johab fonts
  will use johab, JIS208 and SJIS fonts will use SJIS, Big5 will use big5 encoding.
  Fonts with a "Full Unicode" encoding will have both a 2 byte unicode encoding
  table and a 4 byte table. OpenType CID keyed fonts will be saved with Unicode
  encoding.
  <P>
  Postscript fonts are generated in whatever encoding the font is using (except
  if you take a two byte encoding and generate a Type1 font (rather than a
  Type0) then only the first few (256) glyphs will be encoded). Type0 does
  not support a full Unicode (4 byte) encoding.
  <P>
  PS CID (and OpenType CID in the CFF) are saved with no encoding. The encodings
  live in separate cmap files which are available from
  <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/acrrasianfontpack.html">adobe</A>
  (and perhaps other font vendors).
  <P>
  If you save a CID font with a format other than PS CID or OpenType CID, then
  only the currently displayed subfont will be saved, with the current meaningless
  glyph ordering (I suppose this is useful if you wish to extract a sub-font
  from a CID font).
  <P>
  SVG fonts don't really have the concept of an encoding other than Unicode.
  <P>
  TTF (and OpenType) fonts will produce vertical metrics tables if the font
  has vertical metrics enabled. Postscript encodings will not produce Metrics2
  dictionaries (If someone actually wants this let me know, it can be done,
  but I get the impression that nobody uses this any more).
  <P>
  On Mac OS/X, when generating a resource font containing a postscript font
  then the filename textfield will not be present (as the filename is determined
  by the fontname). You can still select a directory however.
  <P>
  The bitmap sizes must all be present in the font database. AntiAliased fonts
  can be indicated by following the pixelsize by "@&lt;depth&gt;" (ie. "@8").
  <P>
  If you are generating a bdf font then you will be prompted for a resolution
  later.
  <P>
  See the section on <A HREF="encodingmenu.html#namelist">namelists</A> for
  a discussion of the "Force glyph names to" field.
  <P>
  If you generate a TrueType or OpenType font with the OpenType mode set (note:
  the term "OpenType" means two things, a truetype wrapper around a postscript
  font, or a set of tables containing typographic information -- here the OpenType
  mode refers to the typographic tables) then FontForge will generate
  <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS, GSUB, and GDEF tables</A>. These contain kerning,
  ligature information, arabic forms data, anchor points, etc.
  <P>
  Apple does not support these OpenType layout tables. If you set Apple mode
  <A HREF="gposgsub.html#AAT">'kern', 'opbd', 'morx', 'feat', 'lcar' and 'prop'
  </A>tables may be generated instead. (and a couple of other small differences
  will appear).
  <P>
  If you set both Apple and OpenType then both sets of tables will be generated.
  If you set neither, then only the 'kern' table will be generated, and it
  will only contain pair-wise kerning (no kerning classes, no kerning by state
  machine). This is the kind of kerning available in the original truetype
  spec (from which both Apple and OpenType have diverged, but which both still
  support).

    Generate <A NAME="Mac-Family">Mac</A> Family
  </H2>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="GenerateFamily.png" WIDTH="414" HEIGHT="552" ALIGN="Right">This
  brings up a dialog very similar to the above, but with a few added fields.
  Because this dialog is for Mac families, only Mac formats are supported.
  <P>
  Right above the [Save] button is a list of all fonts that FontForge thinks
  should be included in this family, along with their bitmap info. If you don't
  want a font to be in the family simply uncheck its checkbox.
  <P>
  The font styles that are allowed in a family are limited by the capabilities
  of the mac 'FOND' resource which only allows one style of a given type and
  does not support the concepts of "Light", "Black" (if there is already a
  "Bold" style), "Oblique" (if there is already an "Italic" style), etc. Generally
  FontForge will be able to figure out a font's style from its fontname, but
  in some cases you may wish to override this by setting the
  <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Mac-Style">mac style </A>directly in fontinfo.
  <P>
  For information on creating mac font families beyond the capabilities of
  this dialog look at the <A HREF="faq.html#How-family">FAQ</A>.

    <A NAME="svg">SVG</A> fonts
  </H2>
  <P>
  SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) fonts, come in two forms, one corresponds
  roughly to a PostScript Type1 font, and one to a PostScript Type 3 font.
  <P>
  In the first format a set of contours is specified for each glyph. There
  is no indication given whether the font should be stroked or filled -- that
  informaton will have inherited from the graphical environment when the font
  is used on text.
  <P>
  In the second format each glyph may contain the stroke and fill commands
  needed to draw it.
  <P>
  FontForge usually generates the first format, but for multi layered or stroked
  fonts it will generate the second format.
