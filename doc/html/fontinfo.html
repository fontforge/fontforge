  The Font Info dialog is available from all views. It allows you to name your
  font and various other useful bits of information. In a
  <A HREF="fontview.html#CID">CID keyed font</A>, things are more complex.
  Each CID keyed font is composed of man sub-fonts; this command works on the
  current sub-font while there is a <A HREF="cidmenu.html#FontInfo">separate
  command</A> to access the information for the font as a whole -- that dialog
  looks the same. The dialog is composed of many different sub dialogs.

  <P>
  PostScript fonts have several different names, but basically there are two
  important ones: the family name (like Times) and the fontname (which is the
  family name with a bunch of modifiers like Bold Italic Condensed tacked on
  to the end. The FullName is designed to be read by humans, while the others
  are for machines, this name can contain spaces (like "New Century Schoolbook-Bold
  Condensed"). Finally there is the weight name. All of these names should
  be in ASCII. If you wish to enter names with characters outside this range
  look at the <A HREF="#TTF-Names">TTF Names</A> Section.
  <P>
  The copyright field can contain whatever you want to put there, but it's
  a good place to put a copyright.
  <P>
  In most fonts the version field is a string (and so has minimal constraints
  on it), but in CID keyed fonts it must be a floating point number.
  <P>
  You may also specify a separate version number to be used in any sfnt generated
  from this database; this should be a floating point number. Or you may leave
  this field blank. If you leave it blank FontForge will generate a default
  value based on other version information specified elsewhere.
  <P>
  Normally when <A HREF="generate.html">generating a font,</A> FontForge will
  use the fontname as the base for the default filename of the font file (the
  base to which the extension is added). But that is not always what you want.
  You may wish to attach a version string to the fontname, or abbreviate it,
  etc. The <CODE>Base Filename</CODE> field allows you to specify this to
  fontforge.
  <P>
  Many of these names are similar to the english names of the
  <A HREF="fontinfo.html#TTF-Names">TTF Names</A> section. If nothing is specified
  in that section then the names specified here will be used by default in
  ttf files.

  </H2>
  <P>
  This sub dialog contains a rather random collection of settings.
  <P>
  The Ascent and Descent are (in this current definition) Macintosh concepts
  rather than PostScript, their sum, however, provides the size of the em-square
  and that is very much a postscript concept. For postscript fonts this number
  is set by strong convention to be 1000, while in most TrueType fonts it will
  be 2048 (also a convention, but TrueType claims rasterization is faster if
  the sum is a power of 2). Since both TrueType and Type1 (postscript) fonts
  represent numbers as 16-bit integers ascent and descent must be less than
  32767. TrueType is more restrictive and requires their sum to be less than
  16384.
  <P>
  If you change the size of the Em you may choose to have all the outlines
  (and kerning info) scaled to have the same proportion to the new value that
  they had to the old. Warning: <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>If your font has
  truetype instructions scaling may break the font as entries in the <CODE>'cvt
  '</CODE> table will not be scaled.</STRONG></FONT>
  <P>
  The Italic Angle indicates the slant of the font. FontForge can attempt to
  guess a good value for you by looking at the stems of certain letters ("I"
  for instance).
  <P>
  The underline position and height provide a program using this font a hint
  as to where it should place a line if it wants to underline text printed
  in this font.
  <P>
  If you want your font to have <A NAME="vertical">vertical</A> metrics (generally
  this means you are working on a CJK font) then check the <CODE>[*] Has Vertical
  Metrics</CODE> checkbox. This will enable the Vertical Origin field, and
  will mean that when you generate a truetype or opentype font a vertical metrics
  table will be added. The Vertical Origin is the vertical offset from the
  origin of the design coordinate system to the origin for the purposes of
  vertical metrics.
  <P>
  <A NAME="Interpretation">Sadly</A> the encoding is not always sufficient
  for understanding the font's behavior. For example a unicode font designed
  for a chinese system will look very different from a unicode font for a japanese
  system (The same unicode character may map to very different chinese or japanese
  glyphs). To handle this FontForge has the concept of "Interpretation".
  <P>
  When you create a new glyph in a font, fontforge will assign it a name based
  on the current
  <A HREF="encodingmenu.html#namelist">namelist</A>.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
  <H2>
    <IMG SRC="fontinfo-layers.png" WIDTH="607" HEIGHT="547" ALIGN="Right"><A
	NAME="Layers">Layers</A>
  </H2>
  <P>
  You may control how many and what types of layers are available in your font.
  <P>
  Fonts may be either outlined or stroked, or type3. You may choose which kind
  of font you want.
  <P>
  You may also decide what kind of splines you want in the font in general,
  often all the layers will use the same type of splines (so there are radio
  buttons to make that easy), but it isn't required each layer may be in its
  own format.
  <P>
  If you mark a layer as quadratic (or check <CODE>[*] All layers Quadratic)
  </CODE>then FontForge will use quadratic
  <A HREF="overview.html#spline">B&eacute;zier</A> splines for this layer rather
  than cubic B&eacute;ziers, this means that FontForge will be using the native
  spline format of truetype rather than postscript (or opentype). When FontForge
  generates a font it will convert from whatever format is used internally
  to whatever format is required for the font, so there will be no problem
  if this is set incorrectly, but setting it correctly for your font means
  you get a clearer idea of what the outlines will look like. I find quadratic
  splines harder to edit with because each spline is less flexible, but the
  advantage of actually seeing what your truetype font will look like may outweigh
  that.
  <P>
  You may also mark a layer as a foreground layer or a background layer. Background
  layers can hold images. Pasting into an empty glyph in a background layer
  will not set the width. Splines in background layers do not make a glyph
  worth outputting.<BR Clear=ALL>

  <A HREF="UniqueID.html">Adobe now says</A> that both XUID and UniqueID are
  unnecessary.
  <P>
  The XUID field is a collection of numbers separated by spaces and enclosed
  in brackets. This allows you to specify the extended unique ID of the font.
  If you have set the XUID preference entry then FontForge will assign values
  to all new fonts (by appending a number unique to this font to the end of
  your preference item). Adobe recommends that the XUID be changed every time
  the font is changed, so each time you generate a postscript font, that font's
  XUID (if present) will be incremented by 1 (This incrementing does not happen
  in CID-keyed fonts, where the XUID behavior is too complex for this simple
  trick). (The XUID field is only meaningful in PostScript fonts).
  <P>
  The UniqueID field is an older convention for the same purpose as XUID. If
  you do not fill in this field then FontForge will pick a random number for
  you in the allowable range. If you want your font to have no unique id then
  give this the value of -1. If you have talked to Adobe and been assigned
  a real UniqueID then you may use this field, otherwise leave it blank. (The
  UniqueID field is only meaningful in PostScript fonts)<BR CLEAR=ALL>

  <P>
  <IMG SRC="fontinfo-private.png" WIDTH="480" HEIGHT="548" ALIGN="Right">This
  sub-dialog shows most entries in the font's Private dictionary. The interesting
  things in this dictionary are mostly concerned with hints appropriate for
  the entire font. I shall not go into detail about the meanings of the various
  entries, that is best understood by reading
  <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/T1_SPEC.PDF">Adobe's
  Type1 specification</A>.
  <P>
  Don't try to change these until you understand what they mean.
  <P>
  The dialog is shown at right. It consists of a list of dictionary key/value
  pairs. The keys are on the left, values on the right. Generally you will
  want to use the standard PostScript keys (these are available from a pulldown
  list that appears when you press one of the little grey buttons).
  <P>
  Note: The values must be things which PostScript can parse. This means that
  <CODE>ForceBold</CODE> must have a value of "false" or "true", and "False"
  or "faux" will not work. Similarly the decimal point in numbers must be "."
  (not ","). If you enter a "," by mistake FontForge will convert it for you.
  <P>
  For example the <CODE>BlueValues</CODE> entry specifies certain key regions
  of the font in a vertical direction. For instance it might contain the baseline
  serif, the x-height serif, the cap-height serif. It is expressed as an array
  of numbers, grouped in pairs. The first number of a pair is the low end of
  the region and the second is the high end. So in the example at right, the
  value of <CODE>BlueValues</CODE> is <CODE>[-20 0 437 457 583 603 623
  643</CODE>.
  <P>
  When the <CODE>[Guess]</CODE> button is enabled FontForge thinks it can make
  a reasonable guess for the value of the currently selected entry.
  <P>
  The <CODE>[Histogram]</CODE> button is similar, it will bring up a
  <A HREF="histogram.html">dialog showing a histogram</A> of the values of
  an attribute of the font. The hope is that this will allow you to pick a
  good value for the entry.
  <P>
  You may also delete an entry from the dictionary with the <CODE>[Delete]
  </CODE>button. Some entries (such as <CODE>BlueValues</CODE>) must be present
  in any type1 font, but you may still delete them. FontForge will simply guess
  at a reasonable value when it needs to generate the font.
  <P>
  Certain keys affect things other than hints. The <CODE>lenIV</CODE> entry
  controls how much random padding is placed around the type1 strings when
  the font is generated. Normally this will be 4, but if you want to save space
  (4 bytes per glyph in pfb format, 8 bytes in pfa) you may choose another
  value. The UniqueID key represents the font's Unique postscript ID. If you
  provide a value here then FontForge will copy it into the UniqueID field
  in the Font Dictionary. (this is different from True Type's UniqueID. They
  perform the same function but are formatted differently).
  <P>
  Some of these entries are only meaningful for PostScript fonts, others will
  be used by the truetype autoinstructor.<BR CLEAR=ALL>

  </H2>
  <P>
  This sub dialog contains settings important for Windows platforms, most of
  these settings live in the 'OS/2' table of a truetype or opentype font. The
  pane also includes a few pieces of data that do not live in the 'OS/2' table
  but are logically related.
  <P>
  The weight class provides a numeric value describing the boldness of the
  font. A normal face will usually have a boldness of 400, and a bold face
  will usually be 700. This must be a number between 100 and 900.
  <P>
  The width class allows you to provide a numeric value saying how condensed
  or expanded this font is.
  <P>
  The PFM Family is used when generating PFM files and classifies the font
  into some rather broad categories (Serif, Sans, Monospace, Script, Decorative).
  <P>
  You can control whether you want to allow your font to be embedded into other
  documents (most commonly pdf). You can restrict it so that it can never be
  embedded, it can be embedded into documents that can be printed (but not
  edited), it can be embedded into documents that can be edited, or it can
  be embedded into an editable document and later extracted and installed on
  a different system. You can also control whether the document producer is
  allowed to extract the glyphs it needs and make a new font from them (which
  saves space) or whether they must include the entire font if they use any
  of it. Finally you can restrict the embedding so that only bitmap versions
  of the font may be embedded. (meaningful in CID keyed postscript fonts as
  well as TTF and OTF).
  <P>
  The "Vendor ID" is a four character ASCII field used to identify the creator
  of the font.
  <P>
  The IBM Family is another classification scheme for fonts.
  <P>
  Finally you may order lookups in the GSUB (or morx) table.
  <P>
  These entries are only meaningful in TrueType and OpenType fonts (though
  the Embeddable entry (generally called FSType) will be set on CID keyed fonts
  even if they are not in an OpenType wrapper.<BR CLEAR=ALL>

  This dialog allows you to control the order features in which are to be executed
  by the word processing program. If you have loaded an opentype or truetype
  font then the original order will be maintained. As you add more features
  they will appear at the bottom of the list (which may not be appropriate).
  You may select a feature name and use the buttons to move it up and down
  in the list. Things at the top of the list are executed first, things at
  the bottom last.
  <P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>Although the OpenType spec
  claims that the execution of features (actually lookups) will be ordered
  by their appearence in the lookup table, MicroSoft claims that they will
  apply features in the order that they think best. So the order specified

  <P>
  The Windows Ascent and Descent fields are badly defined in the OpenType spec,
  which says that they should express the maximum range of the Windows "ANSI"
  glyphs. If one uses this definition, non-"ANSI" glyphs are cropped. These
  should be the maximum range of all glyphs to avoid cropping. But even that
  will not always work. If you have a line with marks which are repositioned
  with GPOS, then the marks may be cropped, so Windows Ascent should include
  the maximum possible height of repositioned marks (or any other GPOS vertical
  repositioning feature).
  <P>
  This is too complex (and too ill defined) for FontForge to figure out, instead
  FontForge gives you a couple of options.
  <OL>
    <LI>
      You may set WinAscent and WinDescent directly. Turn off the "[ ] Is Offset"
      checkboxes and any value you provide will be used as is.
    <LI>
      Or you may specify an offset to be added to the maximum ascent and descent
      of the font (which FontForge will compute for you when it saves the font).
      If you don't have a mark to base feature, then I recommend that you set the
      offsets to 0, and check the "[*] Is Offset" checkboxes.
  </OL>
  <P>
  Both WinAscent and WinDescent should be positive numbers.

  The Typographic Ascent and Typographic Descent are <EM>supposed</EM> to represent
  the line spacing of the font on the windows platform. Sadly very few applications
  actually use them (most applications use the Windows Ascent/Descent described
  above).
  <P>
  In traditional (Latin) typography, the unleaded line spacing should be 1em,
  and that is what Adobe recommends for these fields (they should sum to the
  Em-Size specified in the <A HREF="fontinfo.html#PS-General">General</A> pane).
  The Typographic Ascent should be the same as the font's Ascent, and the
  Typographic Descent should be the (negative) of the font's descent.
  <P>
  The "[*] Is Offset" checkboxes behave much as they do above, except they
  specify offsets from the font's ascent and descent rather than its bounding
  box.
  <P>
  The Typographic descent should be a negative number, the ascent a positive
  number.
  <P>
  You can also specify the default line gap, or leading between lines.
  <P>
  The mac uses a different set of fields for the same concepts, and stores
  them in the 'hhea' table rather than the 'OS/2'. The HHead Ascent and Descent
  are used to specify clipping (in some applications) and line spacing. They
  behave very much the way the Win Ascent &amp; Descent behave (they are based
  on bounding box values). And the 'hhea' table has its own line gap field.
  <P>
  And if your font has vertical metrics enabled (See
  <A HREF="fontinfo.html#PS-General">General</A> above) you will be able to
  set the default spacing between vertical columns of text. (the equivalent
  to LineGap in vertical text).

  The OS/2 table contains two fields which give some information about the

  FontForge will generate reasonable values when the font is output. Sometimes

  TrueType (and OpenType) fonts are allowed to have different names in different
  languages. So a French user might see CaslonItalic displayed as CaslonItalique
  in a font menu, while a German user might see CaslonKursive. There are about
  20 different strings which may be customized into various different languages.
  Customizing one string does not mean that you must customize the others (indeed,
  often only the Style string will be customized).
  <P>
  The image at right shows the dialog, displaying all the strings set for the
  given font. You may order these strings based on type of string (ordered
  as below), on language (ordered by unicode), or by a variation of language
  which displays strings for the language of the current locale first, then
  English strings (because, in general, these will be the most important for
  the user) and then ordered by language thereafter.
  <P>
  Certain strings in English (Copyright, Family, Styles, Fullname, Version)
  will always be present. If you do not set them explicitly they will be taken
  (possibly with modifications) from the equivalent postscript strings on the
  <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Names">Names</A> pane. You may not remove these strings,
  and if you wish to modify them you must first detach them from the PostScript.
  In the example at right the strings bound to PostScript are shown in red
  (Copyright, Family, Styles), while Fullname and Version have been detached
  and modified.
  <P>
  You may change the language of a string by clicking the mouse on the language
  field of that string -- a popup menu will appear giving you a choice of all
  supported locale/languages. (You may not modify the language of the special
  English strings mentioned above).
  <P>
  You may change the string type in a similar manner, again you may not change
  the special English strings.
  <P>
  If you click with the right button on a string you will bring up a different
  popup menu which will allow you to:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      Detach a string from its PostScript equivalent if any (so you can modify

      Delete a string entirely (except for the special strings bound to PostScript)
    <LI>

      Fullname
    <DD>
      The concatenation of the Family name and the Styles name
    <DT>
      UniqueID
    <DD>
      This is a string that uniquely identifies the font in a human readable fashion.
      Its format is quite different from postscript's UniqueID and FontForge will
      create an appropriate string if you don't specify one (rather than copying
      from postscript).

      A string containing the version number of the font.

  These settings specify strings for the windows platform with unicode encoding.

  Generally fonts will have a fairly complete set of strings in the American
  English entry, with the Style string (and nothing else) translated into different
  languages.
  <P>
  When you create a Style entry for an language, FontForge will attempt to
  translate the American English style into something appropriate for that
  language. It understands languages in <A HREF="fontstyles.html">the table
  on the font styles page</A>, but not others so it won't always work.
  <P>
  So if your style in American English is "BoldItalic" then after you create
  the appropriate strings FontForge will default to "GrasItalique" for French,
  "FettKursiv" for German, "NigritaCursiva" for Spanish, etc.
  <P>

  <P>
  The OpenType features 'ss01'-'ss20' are magic, and you are allowed to provide
  more interesting names for them than the default "Style Set 01"... This table
  allows you to assign names, in various languages to the various features.
  It is very similar to, though less complicated than, the previous

  </H2>
  <P>
  The TrueType 'gasp' table gives you control over whether the rasterizer should
  do grid-fitting or anti-aliasing at any given pixel size. Note that this
  table only applies to <EM>TrueType</EM> fonts, it does not apply to Type2
  PostScript (fonts with .otf extension).
  <P>
  The table consists of a set of pixel sizes with corresponding flags. For
  each entry in the table the flags apply to all pixel sizes bigger than the
  previous entry but less than or equal to the current entry. The table must
  be terminated with a pixel size of 65535.
  <P>
  Pressing the [Default] button will provide you with a default 'gasp' table.
  If your font contains no instructions this will be different than the 'gasp'
  table for a font with instructions.
  <P>
  MS has recently expanded the table. Version 0 of the table had two bits for
  each pixel value, version 1 has four bits, two of which control the behavior
  of their ClearType rasterizer. They have also added a bit to the 'head' table
  called optimized_for_cleartype; if this bit is not set then some fonts will
  not be hinted.
  <P>
  In the table above:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      All pixel sizes less than or equal to 8 will not be grid-fit but will have
      anti-alias applied
    <LI>
      All pixel sizes between 9 and 16 (inclusive) will be grid-fit but not
      anti-aliased.
    <LI>
      All pixel sizes above 16 will be both grid-fit and anti-aliased, and will

  This allows you to set the TeX font parameters (which are described in Appendix
  F, pp 98-100 of the MetaFont Book). There seem to be 3 different types of
  font parameters, those for text fonts, those for math fonts and those for
  math extension fonts. The later two have additional parameters which are
  accessible through the [More Params] button. The default values for the Math
  parameters are probably reasonable. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>The default

  <P>
  This allows you to set the design size of a font, the design range, and provide
  a style name for this class of font.
  <P>
  In tradtional typography every point size of a given font would be slightly
  different -- generally small point sizes would have proportionally more
  white-space around the glyph and wider stems inside the glyph. This made
  small point sizes more readable than they would otherwise be. Conversely
  large pointsizes would tend to have less white space around them, otherwise
  the letters would appear too far apart.
  <P>
  <A HREF="multiplemaster.html">Multi-master fonts</A> provide one method to
  avoid this problem. This dialog provides another. Suppose you have a series
  of font-faces designed for different point-sizes.

  Then you would fill in this dialog to allow the font system to figure out
  which font was appropriate for which point size. The dialog displays the
  font's optimal size -- its design size, and the point range within which
  it can be used.
  <P>
  In the example above all the different fonts would have the same "Style-ID"
  this is an arbetrary number that links all fonts with this ID together (all
  fonts in the same family, that is). However, Ambrosia-Italic-Text would have
  a different Style ID. All fonts with the same Style ID should have the same
  Style Name. Note that font names are now something like
  "Ambrosia-Regular-Heading" -- the user should not be subjected to that
  complication, as far as s/he is concerned there is just a font called
  "Ambrosia-Regular" and all four of the above fonts are just instances of
  it. So the Style Name of all four fonts above should be "Regular".
  <P>
  Adobe allows two forms of size information. In one, only the design size
  field is specified, in the other all the fields must be specified. This
  means that if you want to supply a design range you are also required to
  provide a style id and name.<BR Clear=All>

  for mark sets, but that will change (Both Adobe and MicroSoft say their next
  releases will support it).
  <P>
  The idea behind both is similar: In many lookups it is important to be able
  to ignore some mark glyphs, but not others. For example when forming an arabic
  ligature, the vowel marks are (usually) irrelevant to the ligature and you
  would want to ignore all marks. In situations where you are positioning marks
  on a base glyph you might in one case, want to ignore all marks that position
  on top of the glyph while paying attention to those underneath it. And then
  in another lookup, the reverse might be true.
  <P>
  At any rate, in some cases it is important to be able to categorize marks.
  Both classes and sets let you do this. In the example right, latin marks
  have been divided into those above the glyph and those below.
  <P>
  A glyph may appear in at most one class, while it may appear in many sets.
  So when implemented, sets will be more versatile. On the other hand classes
  can be stored more compactly in the font file (a slight advantage).

  The order in which the lookups appear in this dialog is the order in which

  Displays what fontforge thinks is the create date and modification date of
  the font data. FontForge started retaining those dates in August of 2006,
  any prior dates are conjectural and based on a best guess -- usually from
  the modification time of the sfd file. When loading a font from somthing
  other than an sfd file, FontForge will again make the best guess it can.

  Displays information about the various unicode character ranges included
  in the font.
  <P>
  If you click on a range, the font view will select all characters in that
  range and scroll to one of them.
  <P>
  If you double click on a range, the font view will select any characters
  not defined in the font within that range, and scroll to one of
  them.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
