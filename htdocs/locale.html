FontForge can be localized with different message strings for different
languages.
<P>
I have created an incomplete (and probably wrong in many places) french version.
<P>
FontForge will detect if the LANG variable is set at start up and if so will
try to find an appropriate .ui file. You may also set the language file directly
from the preference dialog (if you do this the LANG variable will not be
examined).

<P>
FontForge has UI translations to Japanese, French, Italian and Russian (for
which I am indebted to KANOU Hiroki, Pierre Hanser, Claudio Beccari and Valek
Filippov respectively). If you want to work on another language then...
<P>
Take the file nomen.en.c and save it as nomen.&lt;your language code&gt;.c,
then edit it and translate as many of the strings as you want to (remove
the ones you don't translate). When you are done run makenomenh and it should
create a file fontforge.&lt;your language code&gt;.ui. If this is placed
in the same directory as fontforge then it should be found at start up. If
you send me a copy of it, I'll include it in the distribution.
