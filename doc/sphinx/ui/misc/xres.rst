X Resources
===========

Every X application has an inordinate number of resources that you can tweak.
This one is no exception. However I don't follow standard conventions, so it's
all different. Sorry (a little anyway).

To use an X resource add a series of lines to your .Xdefaults file and then run
"$ xrdb ~/.Xdefaults". For example:

::

   Gdraw.ScreenWidthInches: 14.7
   Gdraw.GGadget.Popup.Font: 10pt helvetica
   Gdraw.Background: white
   fontforge.FontView.FontFamily: Helvetica, GillSans

Some systems (the mac) will not automatically load X resources when starting X,
in this case you must explicitly tell fontforge where to find a resource file
with the preference item:
:ref:`File->Preference->Generic->ResourceFile <prefs.ResourceFile>`.

You may also use fontforge's resource editor
(:doc:`File->X Resource Editor <resedit>`)

If a resource begins with "\ ``Gdraw.``" or "\ ``fontforge.``" then the program
will look at it.

.. object:: Gdraw.ScreenWidthCentimeters

   A double. (centimeters)

   X usually does not know the physical width of a screen (it knows the logical,
   pixel width). Gdraw's internals are based on points rather than pixels, and
   it will sometimes pick a font that is too small or too large if it relies on
   X's idea of how wide the screen is.

.. object:: Gdraw.ScreenWidthInches

   A double. (inches)

   Same as the above, except measured in inches.

.. object:: Gdraw.ScreenWidthPixels

   An integer (pixels)

   When X creates a virtual screen it may not be possible for Gdraw to find the
   actual number of pixels on the screen. This again will throw off point
   calculations.

.. object:: Gdraw.ScreenHeightPixels

   An integer (pixels)

   When X creates a virtual screen it may not be possible for Gdraw to find the
   actual number of pixels on the screen. This is not used in point
   calculations.

.. object:: Gdraw.Depth

   An integer (1, 8, 16, 32)

   You can use this to request a different depth than the default one. Not all
   servers will support all depths. If FontForge can't find a visual with the
   desired depth it will use the default depth.

.. object:: Gdraw.VisualClass

   A string ("StaticGray", "GrayScale", "StaticColor", "PsuedoColor",
   "TrueColor", "DirectColor")

   FontForge will search for a visual with the given class (and possibly depth
   if the depth argument is specified too).

.. _xres.Colormap:

.. object:: Gdraw.Colormap

   An string ("Current", "Copy", "Private")

   You can use this to control what FontForge does about the colormap on an 8bit
   screen

   * Current -- FontForge will attempt to allocate its colors in the current
     colormap.
   * Copy -- FontForge will allocate what colors it can and then copy the current
     color map into a private copy. This means FontForge has access to a much
     wider range of colors, and (as long as the shared colormap doesn't change)
     FontForge's colormap will match that of the rest of the screen.
   * Private -- FontForge will allocate a private colormap and set the colors just
     as it wants them. It will almost certainly not match the shared colormap.

.. object:: Gdraw.DoDithering

   An integer (0 or 1)

   You can use this to turn off dithering of images on an 8bit screen.

.. object:: Gdraw.MultiClickTime

   An integer (milliseconds)

   The maximum amount of time allowed between two clicks for them to be
   considered a double (triple, etc.) click.

.. object:: Gdraw.MultiClickWiggle

   An integer (pixels)

   The maximum number of pixels the mouse is allowed to move between two clicks
   and have them still be considered a double click.

.. object:: Gdraw.TwoButtonFixup

   A boolean

   On a windows keyboard use the modifier key with the flag on it to simulate
   mouse button 2 (middle button). If this key is depressed when a mouse button
   is pressed or released then pretend it was button 2 that was pressed or
   release.

.. object:: Gdraw.DontOpenXDevices

   a booleanVarious people have complained that when FontForge attempts to open
   the devices of the wacom graphics tablet, the X server gives a BadDevice
   error. I can't duplicate this, the open works fine on my system, but this
   resource allows them to tell fontforge not to try to use the tablet.

.. object:: Gdraw.MacOSXCmd

   A boolean

   On Mac OS X the user will probably expect to use the Command (apple,
   cloverleaf) key to control the menu (rather than the Control key). If this is
   set then the command key will be mapped to the control key internally.

.. object:: Gdraw.MultiClickWiggle

   An integer (pixels)

   The maximum number of pixels the mouse is allowed to move between two clicks
   and have them still be considered a double click.

.. _xres.Keyboard:

.. object:: Gdraw.Keyboard

   ibm | mac | sun | ppc | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3

   Allows you to specify the type of keyboard. Currently this is only relevant
   when generating menus. The modifier keys are in different locations on
   different keyboards (under different operating systems) and if FontForge
   knows what keyboard you are using it can make the hot-keys have better
   labels.

   * ibm | 0

     Uses the Control and Alt keys
   * mac | 1

     Uses the Command and Option keys (Mac OS/X, Mac keyboard)
   * ppc | 3

     Uses the Control and Command keys (Suse ppc linux, Mac keyboard)
   * sun | 2

     Uses the Control and Meta keys

.. object:: Gdraw.SelectionNotifyTimeout

   An integer (seconds)

   Gdraw will wait this many seconds after making a request for a selection (ie.
   when doing a Paste). If it gets no response after that period it reports a
   failure.

   "~/" at the start of a directory will be interpreted as the user's home
   directory. If a directory is "=" then the installed pixmap directory will be
   used.

.. _xres.color:

.. object:: Colors

   Colors may be specified as:

   * rgb(r,g,b)

     where r,g and b are doubles between 0 and 1.0
   * argb(a,r,g,b)

     where a,r,g, and b are doubles between 0 and 1.0

     (The alpha channel is only supported in windows with cairo -- that is the
     glyph view. Alpha 1.0 is fully opaque, alpha 0.0 should be fully transparent,
     values in between are translucent. Since drawing something fully transparent
     has no effect, FontForge treats transparent spot colors as fully opaque).
   * rgb(r%,g%,b%)

     where r, g, and b are doubles between 0% and 100%
   * hsv(h,s,v)

     A color expressed as hue (between 0 and 360), saturation (0.0 and 1.0) and
     value (0.0 and 1.0)
   * hsl(h,s,l)

     A color expressed as hue (between 0 and 360), saturation (0.0 and 1.0) and
     luminosity (0.0 and 1.0)
   * r g b

     where r, g, and b are decimal integers between 0 and 255
   * #rgb

     where r, g, and b are hex digits between 0 and 15 (0xf)
   * #rrggbb

     where rr, gg, bb are hex numbers between 0x00 and 0xff
   * #aarrggbb

     where aa, rr, gg, bb are hex numbers between 0x00 and 0xff

     (The alpha channel is only supported in cairo windows. If alpha is 0, then
     fontforge will treat the color as opaque because drawing a completely
     transparent spot color does nothing).
   * #rrrrggggbbbb

     where rrrr, gggg, bbbb are hex numbers between 0x0000 and 0xffff
   * or one of the color names accepted on the net (red, green, blue, cyan,
     magenta, yellow, white, black, maroon, olive, navy, purple, lime, aqua, teal,
     fuchsia, silver)

.. _xres.font:

.. object:: Fonts

   A font may be specified as:

   <boldness> <italicness> <pointsize> <familyname>

   (I know the order looks a bit weird but that's what is used by css).

   * <boldness> can be:

     * nothing -- the font is not bold
     * bold -- the font is bold
     * a number -- (between 0 and 999), a numeric value that gives some idea of how
       bold the font should be. 200 would be a light font, 400 an normal font, 700 a
       bold font and 999 and ultra-black font.
   * <italicness> can be:

     * nothing -- the font is not italic
     * italic -- the font is italic
     * oblique -- the font is oblique (italic)
   * <pointsize> can be:

     * nothing -- a default point size is chosen
     * a number followed by "pt" -- specifies the point size.

   Examples

   * bold 14pt helvetica

     Helvetica Bold at 14 points
   * italic 10pt times

     Times italic at 10 points


.. _xres.Keyboards:

Keyboards and Mice.
-------------------

FontForge assumes that your keyboard has a control key and some equivalent of a
meta key. FontForge works best with a three button mouse.

Almost all keyboards now-a-days will have the needed modifier keys, but which
key is used for what will depend on the keyboard and the OS (for instance
XDarwin and suse linux use quite different mappings for the modifier keys on the
mac keyboard). Usually this is only relevant for menus (and mnemonics).
FontForge tries to guess the keyboard from the environment in which it was
compiled. But with X this may not always be appropriate. So the
":ref:`Gdraw.Keyboard <xres.Keyboard>`" resource above may be used to change
this. (Currently this setting only control the labels that appear in menus for
the hotkeys).

Mice are more problematic. On PCs we usually have two button mice and on mac
single button mice. Many linuxes that run on a PC will give you an option of
simulating the middle button of the mouse by depressing the left and right
buttons simultaneously. FontForge will also allow you to simulate it by holding
down the super key (usually this is the one with the picture of a windows flag
on it) while depressing either mouse button.

On the mac I don't see any good way of simulating a three button mouse...
