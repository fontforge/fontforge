/**
 * Many lists in FontForge are singly linked. At times you might want
 * to append to the list which, when you only have a pointer to the
 * start of the list can be more verbose than one would like. To use
 * this macro you must defined a null initialized variable 'last'
 * outside of any loop that traverses the source list. The last
 * variable is used used by this macro to quickly append to the list
 * as you go. This macro also assumes that the 'last' and 'newitem'
 * types have a member "->next" which contains the single linked list
 * pointer to the next element.
 *
 * Efficient list append should really be a one line call in the bulk
 * of the code :)
 *
 * example:
 * MyListObjectType* newfoolast = 0;
 * MyListObjectType* newfoolist = 0;
 * 
 * for( ... iterate a source collection of foos ... )
 * {
 *    MyListObjectType* foocopy = CopyIt( foo );
 *    FFLIST_SINGLE_LINKED_APPEND( newfoolist, newfoolast, foocopy );
 * }
