  Command Line Arguments
</H1>
<P>
<CODE>$ fontforge [-options] [filenames]<BR>
$ fontforge [-script] scriptfile [arguments]</CODE>
<P>
The filenames may specify any number of files in one of the font formats
that FontForge recognizes (various postscript formats, truetype, opentype,
mac resource, bitmap).
<P>
Some files (.ttc or mac resource) may contain more than one outline font.
You may pick which font you want by following the filename with the fontname
in parentheses, thus:<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ fontforge "gulim.ttc(GulimChe)"</CODE><BR>
will select the font GulimChe out of the font file gulim.ttc.
<P>
FontForge recognizes the following options:
<DL>
  <DT>
    -cmap type
  <DD>
    Where type may be<BR>

    Allows you to specify the type of keyboard. Currently this is only relevent
    when generating menus. The modifier keys are in different locations on different
    keyboards (under different operating systems) and if FontForge knows what
    keyboard you are using it can make the hot-keys have better labels.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	ibm | 0<BR>
	Uses the Control and Alt keys
      <LI>
	mac | 1<BR>
	Uses the Command and Option keys (Mac OS/X, Mac keyboard)
      <LI>
	ppc | 3<BR>

    several sfd files.

    Creates a new font.
  <DT>
    -nosplash
  <DD>

  <DT>
    -recover type
  <DD>
    Where type may be:
    <DL>

      <DD>
	Do not attempt any automatic file recovery
      <DT>

    </DL>
  <DT>
    -<A NAME="script">script</A> script-file
  <DD>
    If FontForge's first argument is "-script" then the argument that follows
    will be treated as a <A HREF="scripting.html">script file</A> and all the
    remaining arguments will be passed as arguments to that file. (The "-script"
    argument may be omitted, and if the first argument is an executable file
    which whose first line starts with "#!" and contains "fontforge". This means
    that fontforge may be used as an interpretter. Ie. you can create a fontforge
    script file and type its name to your shell and fontforge will be invoked
    to process that file as a script file (passing any arguments to it)).
  <DT>
    -sync

    (See the X manuals for a description of what these mean). FontForge will
    search through the visuals in an attempt to find one with the desired VisualClass
    (given here) and depth (given with the -depth option).
</DL>
