.SH DESCRIPTION
The program \fBsfddiff\fP compares two font files,
which may be in any format that \fBfontforge\fP(1) can read.
It will notice the following differences:
.TP 4
1)
Characters are present in one font but not in the other.
.TP
2)
Characters are present in both fonts but have different sets
of outlines or references. The outlines may be compared so that
only exact matches are accepted, or so that a fuzzier match is
used.  Similarly references may need to match exactly, or may be
matched after an unlink.  This fuzzy comparison is useful when
comparing truetype and postscript fonts, or when comparing a font
with references to one without. 
.TP
3)
The PostScript hints or TrueType instructions are different.
.TP
4)
The font names (the TrueType 'name' tables) differ.
.TP
5)
The kerning (and other 'gpos' information) differs.
.TP
6)
The ligatures (and other 'gsub' information) differ.
.TP
7)
Any bitmap strikes present in one font but not in the other.
.TP
8)
Any bitmap characters present in one strike of one font
but not in the equivalent strike of the other.
.TP
9)
Any bitmap characters which differ.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 16
.B \-\-help
Provide a description with a list of the available options.
.TP
.B \-\-ignorehints
Suppress the reporting of hint/instruction differences. 
.TP
.B \-\-ignoregpos
Suppress the reporting of kerning (and other 'gpos') differences. 
.TP
.B \-\-ignoregsub
Suppress the reporting of ligature (and other 'gsub') differences. 
.TP
.B \-\-ignorenames
Suppress the reporting of name string differences. 
.TP
.B \-\-ignorebitmaps
Suppress the reporting of bitmap differences. 
.TP
.B \-\-exact
Require outlines to match exactly. 
.TP
.B \-\-warn
Warn if the outlines/references are slightly different.
.TP
\fB\-\-merge\fP \fIoutfile\fP
Store a merged version of the two fonts into the specified
output file.  The merged data will be based on \fIsfdfile1\fP,
any characters present in \fIsfdfile2\fP but not in
\fIsfdfile1\fP will be added, and the outlines of \fIsfdfile2\fP
will be placed in the background.  Finally, for any characters
with different outlines or references the background of the
character will contain the outlines from \fIsfdfile2\fP
(references will be unlinked into outlines and those outlines
also will be added). 
.TP
.B \-\-usage
Display the usage description. 
.TP
.B \-\-version
Display the current version.
