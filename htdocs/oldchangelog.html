	  <P>
	  Changes to create a stub Mac application. Add an apple event handler to fontforge
	  so that it will notice when the finder wants it to open files. Add icons,
	  etc. so it will look like a mac app.
	<LI>
	  Make it possible to drag and drop lookups
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      from one font info window to another<BR>
	      &nbsp; &nbsp; (copy lookups from one font to another)
	    <LI>
	      within a font info window<BR>
	      &nbsp; &nbsp; (reorder lookups)
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Layers can now be marked as either background or foreground.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Foreground layers may be generated into fonts
	    <LI>
	      Background layers may contain images. Pasting into an empty glyph in a background
	      layer will not set the width. Splines in background layers do not make a
	      glyph worth outputting.
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Add a color picker so users can select glyph label colors other than red,
	  cyan, green, etc.
	<LI>
	  Memory problems with references, introduced recently, have been fixed.
	<LI>
	  I hope I'm now getting keysyms right for non-latin menu short cuts.
	<LI>
	  Typo in background layer patch could cause a crash in fonts with many layers.
	<LI>
	  Werner wants an $iscid variable to determine whether a font is a cid-keyed
	  font or not.
	<LI>
	  add font.iscid to python too.
	<LI>
	  python font.cid* variables didn't work, fix them.
	<LI>
	  Add $haspython variable to normal scripting so I can detect if python is
	  available.
	<LI>
	  When pasting a reference into an order2 layer, ff would sometimes miss the
	  fact that the instructions were out of date.
	<LI>
	  Replace with references had the same problem.
	<LI>
	  In scripting, instructions did not get checked for up-to-dateness
	<LI>
	  In the charview, unlink ref only worked on the foreground layer.
	<LI>
	  Patch by Barry (fixed up by me) to fix up open charviews when a layer is
	  added.
	<LI>
	  Barry points out that Contour.round and Layer.round are supposed to have
	  an optional argument, but instead have a required arg.
	<LI>
	  Just as pasting references screws up instructions, so does replace with
	  reference. Do the same thing that we just did to rplref.
	<LI>
	  When scripting without a UI, the char changed routine did not check to see
	  if it should clear the instructions on a change. It now does.
	<LI>
	  Setting device table adjustments from the accent pane of the Math dlg didn't
	  work.
	<LI>
	  File-&gt;Revert File (from the UI) didn't work.
	<LI>
	  If a contextual chaining pos/sub in a sfd file referred to a non-existant
	  lookup we would insert a NULL lookup into a rule. This would cause almost
	  anything that used that lookup to crash. Now, simply remove the sequence/lookup
	  info.
	<LI>
	  When importing lookups we might import a lookup twice if it were nested.
	<LI>
	  When generating bitmaps automatically from a script it was possible that
	  the freetype library got initialized too late and we'd pass a NULL pointer
	  to FT_Memory_Face -- and things would crash.
	<LI>
	  In a quadratic layer of a glyph, when selecting an on-curve point and trying
	  to make it interpolated, if that point had no control points then behavior
	  was odd.
	<LI>
	  didn't create an input context for top level window char and font views.
	  This meant could only use ASCII in menus if the focus were in the top level
	  window (in the scroll bars, or the menu bar.
	<LI>
	  Typo in the code to display side bearings in the charview.
	<LI>
	  FontForge assumed that all anchor classes for a given subtable were in sequence,
	  but Panov has a font where an anchor class for a different subtable appears
	  in the middle of a list of classes for the desired subtable. Result was garbage
	  output, and View-&gt;Show Att crashed.
	<LI>
	  View-&gt;Next/Prev [Def] &amp; Find In Font View don't work in charviews
	  when there are tabs active.
	<LI>
	  R. Sander points out that if you select an ordered set of lookups in one
	  font and import them into another they become disordered. Not good.
	<LI>
	  When pasting into a charview we only set the width if there was nothing in
	  foreground. When pasting into the fontview we always set the width because
	  we were clearing the foreground before we pasted (unless we did paste into
	  -- then we didn't set the width).
	  <P>
	  With layers that should all change. We should only set the width if there
	  is nothing in any of the potential foreground layers. Don't count the background
	  layers or the grid psuedo layer. Don't count open contours (might be a secondary
	  guide line layer or something). If we're going to clear a layer before pasting
	  (normal behavior in fontview) then don't count the layer cleared.
	<LI>
	  Add several different behavior patterms for the metrics view. Users complain
	  that the current multi-functional window is confusing and would prefer a
	  view which only does kerning, or only sets the advance widths, etc.
	<LI>
	  Due to a typo, merging two splinesets at a curve point generally left the
	  point marked with default adjustment enabled on its control points.
	<LI>
	  Another layers problem. Only in the foreground layer could anchor points
	  be moved.
	<LI>
	  Python glyph.unlinkReference command didn't work.
	<LI>
	  My intent was that ligature carets positioned at 0 didn't count (0 isn't
	  meaningful -- a ligature with a zero-width first component?) but that only
	  got implemented for 'lcar' table not for 'GDEF'. So fix that.
	  <P>
	  Also allow the user to specify exactly how many ligature carets s/he wants
	  rather than just setting a minimum bound.
	  <P>
	  Also 'lcar' (Apple) output was broken.
	  <P>
	  Also neither AAT nor OpenType supports negative lig carets, so if the user
	  drags a lig caret line negative, have it stick at 0.
	<LI>
	  Moving ligature carets always marked for an undo in the foreground layer.
	  Register the movement in the layer in which it happens.
	<LI>
	  When placing an accent glyph about which we know nothing, assume it should
	  be centered on top.
	<LI>
	  Change sfd.c so that it will treat the sequence "backslash newline" as no
	  characters on input (er, except in ASCII85 input). And so that it thinks
	  it can parse version 4 or the sfd format.
	  <P>
	  We don't generate version 4 yet, and we won't for a while. Version 4 will
	  include the ability to insert backslash newline into long lines. This is
	  so we can conform to the internet requirements of fewer than 990 bytes on
	  a line. And the delay is so that people don't scream at me for making an
	  incompatible change to the format -- if I give the parser time to perculate
	  through the user community, with luck no one will even notice -- especially
	  as long lines are rare.
	<LI>
	  Selections/Clipboard didn't work in textfields on 64bit intel. There seems
	  to be a bug in the 64bit Xlib which doesn't transfer 32 bit quantities properly.
	  I was passing unicode strings as 32bit UCS4, but UTF8 will work just fine
	  instead.
	<LI>
	  Add the ability to clear all device tables associated with a kerning by classes
	  table. (Needed because of a bug which introduced garbage).
	<LI>
	  We didn't think we could read in a kerning subtable (class or pair) with
	  device tables, so we converted them to pst data. We can read them in in optimized
	  form and we should do so.
	<LI>
	  Alexej points out that if a glyph has "instructions_out_of_date" set on it,
	  then setting the instructions via a script should clear the bit -- but didn't.
	<LI>
	  Werner points out that if a type2 charstring contained a sequence
	  &lt;num&gt; endchar then ff would set the width of the charater even if the
	  the width had already been set. Width can only be set on first stack clearing
	  operation, any extra params on subsequent calls get ignored.
	  <P>
	  Actually it's worse than that, the spec says that if there are too many things
	  on the stack then start parsing the stack from the unexpected end.
	  <P>
	  Adobe have admitted that the obvious reading of their spec is incorrect (they
	  can't quite bring themselves to say the spec is wrong). So revert some of
	  the way we were parsing type2 charstrings.
	<LI>
	  Barry complains that when building ff does not apply the ".cap" suffix when
	  using inverted breve.
	<LI>
	  Valgrind finds a bug in drawing non-BMP characters in the metrics view.
	<LI>
	  Alexej would like to be able to manipulate non-unicode glyphs with the text
	  field of the metrics view. The textfield used to map all non-unicode code
	  points to 0xfffd, but if the font doesn't make use of the supplementary private
	  use areas (planes 15&amp;16) then create a mapping from the font into these
	  areas so that we can represent non-unicode glyphs as funky private use glyphs.
	  <P>
	  (Only do this if font doesn't use these areas).
	<LI>
	  Alexej points out that in non-foreground quadratic fonts the "Points-&gt;Dont
	  Interpolate" command doesn't do anything.
	  <P>
	  Fix a couple of other foreground specific things too.
	<LI>
	  Barry points out that setting a glyph's anchorPoints from python does not
	  mark a glyph as changed nor force an update.
	<LI>
	  Autoinstructor: large patch from Alexey:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      handlles conflicting H/V stems much better;
	    <LI>
	      tries to place HStems between blues better;
	    <LI>
	      adds optional apparatus for instructing serifs;
	    <LI>
	      relies on generic point-to-stem snapping routines from stemdb.c;
	    <LI>
	      needs FPGM changed (older FF's glyph programs should still work, but FPGMs
	      need updating!).
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  If the user has opened a backup sfd file (one that ends in .sfd~) and does
	  a save on it, then pop up a save as dlg instead of blindly saving it. Saving
	  it back to the backup is probably wrong, yet saving it onto the non-backup
	  version without prompting the user is questionable.
	<LI>
	  glyph.appendAccents didn't mark the glyph as changed nor did it force an
	  update.
	<LI>
	  Barry wants a way to control the use_my_metrics bit of a reference from
	  python.<BR>
	  Give him a hack<BR>
	  glyph.useRefsMetrics(name[,set])
	<LI>
	  Add a glyph.appendAccent() command.
	<LI>
	  Ralf from end-if.de points out that when trying to change the kerning between
	  two glyphs which have a kern class setting of 0, then ff keeps asking the
	  same question several times before a non-zero value is entered. (once when
	  the field is clicked in, once when a minus sign is typed, and once more when
	  a number is entered).
	<LI>
	  The python stuff won't compile under cygwin because it used pointers to stuff
	  in shared libraries as initializers of static variables. It seems windows
	  can't handle that. This patch should provide a work around.
	<LI>
	  Add a font.importLookups (from another font) function to python scripting.
	<LI>
	  When joining two splinesets (during glyph editing) we didn't pay attention
	  to any user settings for the control points, and we'd just always refigure
	  default control points. Now use user specified directions when possible.
	<LI>
	  Add a problem (Find Problems) which will look through all glyphs for those
	  with both contours and references, and which will create a new glyph to contain
	  the contours and make a reference to it in the original.
	  <P>
	  Do something similar for bad transformation matrices (those with members
	  2 or more (or less than -2)).
	<LI>
	  Importing a kerning class from one font to another (and perhaps merging fonts)
	  could cause memory problems if the number of second classes were bigger than
	  the number of first classes.
	<LI>
	  Retain sizes of bitmap and metrics views. People seem to like this even if
	  I don't.
	<LI>
	  Still problems with the guide lines layer
	  <OL>
	    <LI>
	      Displaying a point read bad memory (probably harmless, might cause visual
	      artifacts).
	    <LI>
	      Edit-&gt;Undo in guide layer trampled memory.
	  </OL>
	<LI>
	  Find Problems would occasionally pop up a blank problem dlg.
	<LI>
	  Only show points of inflection in the active layer.
	<LI>
	  If a glyph window were displaying something other than the foreground layer
	  then changes in that window would not be reflected in dependant glyph windows
	  (a change to tilde didn't show in atilde) nor in the fontview.
	<LI>
	  In a cubic glyph with references, turning on point numbering did not renumber
	  the references. They seem to be numbered for TrueType. Not sure where that
	  comes from.
	<LI>
	  Alexey points out that after deleting the active layer, ff does not update
	  the internal bitmap font it used to display glyphs in the font view.
	<LI>
	  Make "-lang ff" work for "-lang=ff", it's more consistent with the rest of
	  the arguments.
	<LI>
	  Add a -unique argument which means that FF checks to see if another fontforge
	  is running on the current screen. If no other fontforge exists things proceed
	  normally, but if there is another, then we send it our arguments and ask
	  it to open them, and then we exit.
	<LI>
	  Make the OFLib dialog have an option to download a preview when you click
	  on a line (rather than requiring you press the [Preview] button for each).
	<LI>
	  The BitmapsAvail and BitmapsRegen scripting functions were broken by the
	  layers patch (they generated bitmaps of whatever was in the background layer).
	<LI>
	  Put in some checks to warn the user when a 'kern' table subtable uses more
	  than 10920 pairs.
	<LI>
	  Give the user one of those "This operation cannot be undone" warnings when
	  deleting a layer in Font Info. (Similar warning about instructions if user
	  changes last quadratic layer(s) to cubic without deleting any).
	<LI>
	  When deleting the last quadratic layer, delete the tt instructions also.
	<LI>
	  When deleting a layer from a font, ff very carefully went through all open
	  glyph views to make sure none was looking at the layer being deleted (and
	  fixing them up if they were) -- but it totally ignored the font views. Their
	  layers needed to be updated too. And the metrics views.
	<LI>
	  The Import menu item in Font Info-&gt;Lookups popup menu was always enabled.
	  It should not have been.
	<LI>
	  Add menu items in Font Info-&gt;Lookups (popup menu) to do a global add/remove
	  language from a specified script in all selected lookups.
	<LI>
	  Get Info (maybe a few other things) didn't work on a selected reference which
	  wasn't in the foreground layer.
	<LI>
	  Copy/Paste of references only worked well in foreground layer.
	<LI>
	  Only in the foreground layer was it possible to select a reference by clicking
	  on it.
	<LI>
	  Snapping to blues was broken due to a typo in the code.
	<LI>
	  Still were a number of places where behavior depended on the spline order
	  in the foreground layer:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Could only debug a glyph if the foreground layer were quadratic
	    <LI>
	      Show gridfit used some point numbers from the foreground layer and some from
	      the layer being shown.
	    <LI>
	      Gridfit didn't change when changing layers.
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Peter Lunicks points out that a tooltip in the prefs dlg actually was for
	  a different preference item.
      </UL>
    <LI>
      20-July-2008
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Updated Russian UI
	<LI>
	  Updated Simplified Chinese UI
	<LI>
	  Small Caps dialog greatly rewritten and merged into the sub/superscript dialog
	  and a new change glyph dialog.
	<LI>
	  Alexey Kryukov makes Small Caps and friends deal with diagonal stems.
	<LI>
	  Update the upload mechanism to OFLib to send a preview image, license text
	  (if specified in our database) and fontlog (again, if in our database). Currently
	  OFLib throws away both the license info and the fontlog, but I hope they
	  will fix that in time.
	<LI>
	  Add a dialog to browse fonts on the OFLib.
	<LI>
	  Fix some bugs in feature file generation of contextual chaining lookups which
	  refer to marks. Note these are not supported in the spec. This is a FontForge
	  only extension.
	<LI>
	  If a script contain no default language features (but did contain some languages)
	  then ff produced a garbage script table for GPOS/GSUB.
	<LI>
	  A number of Dialogs still did not autosize themselves for different languages
	  Create Hints, Kern (Anchor) Pair, Review Hints.
	<LI>
	  Still places where ff uses the foreground layer rather than the current layer
	  to determine if a glyph is quadratic.
	<LI>
	  On systems using different font metrics, the debug pane looks bad with the
	  buttons partly covered by the instruction pane. If the font is large, and
	  the cvt dlg empty, then I'm told ff complains.
	<LI>
	  Barry points out that Add Encoding Slots scrolls to the wrong place.
	<LI>
	  Adding glyphs in compacted encodings caused problems.
	<LI>
	  When the user resizes the outline glyph window, retain that size and use
	  it for the default size of subsequent invocations of the window.
	<LI>
	  It used to be that whenever ff opened an sfd file then all subsequent new
	  fonts (or fonts opened from real font files) would be displayed in windows
	  the same size as the one requested in the sfd file. Only set the window size
	  preference when the user explicitly changes it, not upon openning something
	  with a different setting.
	<LI>
	  In a CID-keyed font, when opening an empty CID slot, ff could trample memory.
	<LI>
	  BlueFuzz support for autohinter and metafont.
	<LI>
	  Add some checks to make sure that we can survive bad font data without crashing.
	<LI>
	  When trying to change kerning between the last two glyphs in the metrics
	  view using the text field (rather than dragging the line) then the textfield
	  would change, but the kerning would not.
	<LI>
	  In the metrics view, give the user several options about the grid (which
	  shows the advance widths of the glyphs)
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      hidden
	    <LI>
	      fully displayed
	    <LI>
	      small lines at the top and bottom of the pane
	    <LI>
	      fully displayed except when the user is adjusting kerning or the advance
	      width, etc. When adjusting grid vanishes until user releases the mouse button.
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  (setting is sticky).
	<LI>
	  Allow the user to customize the colors in the metrics view.
	<LI>
	  In the metrics view (or in the print display dlg) when glyphs are overlapping
	  (e asier to see when glyphs are large) then the places where one glyph ends
	  and another begins often have a faint halo of lighter pixels. Try to improve
	  things and make these joins be more uniform in color.
	<LI>
	  Add minimal support for alpha channels (treat them as a bitmask for transparent).
	<LI>
	  I find it really hard to believe that this is an error, but I have a second
	  hand report that MicroSoft claims that it is. To me making it erroneous is
	  pointless and annoying, but I don't write the spec. <BR>
	  Add to Find Problems and Validate a check to see that if a base glyph (or
	  mark) contains an anchor point in one anchor class in a lookup subtable,
	  then it must have anchor points for ALL anchor classes in that subtable.
	<LI>
	  Fontimage would crash if asked to process a font with glyphs not in BMP.
	  Make fontimage better about fonts which contain no standard scripts (Apostolos's
	  Phaistos font).
	<LI>
	  A few tweaks to make stemdb.c usable for resizing glyphs and stem control.
	<LI>
	  When importing lookups into a font, append the fontname to the lookup name
	  only if there is already a lookup in the new font with the original name.
	<LI>
	  Empty glyphs containing a "." in the name could cause ff to crash when doing
	  or checking to see if it could do a build accented.
	<LI>
	  Gasp editing was broken (still) from the change to the cleartype stuff.
	<LI>
	  Andrey P. would like to see a reference's bounding box in the Element-&gt;Get
	  Info dlg for the reference.
	<LI>
	  Revert glyph had some stray memory references.
	<LI>
	  Add two proposed language tags for IPA use (one for IPA and one for Americanist).
	<LI>
	  In an empty python layer layer.boundingBox should return a tuple of 4 zeros,
	  instead it returned a tuple of 2 zeros and 2 random garbage values.
	<LI>
	  Validate dlg's scrollbar was broken, and you couldn't drag the thumb up to
	  the top (you could get it to the top by other ways).
	<LI>
	  Add a revalidate all menu item to the window to force a reevaluation of the
	  entire font.
	<LI>
	  Add ability to import graphics from a page of a pdf file.
	<LI>
	  Python interface does not catagorize points.
	<LI>
	  The (python) psMat.skew command skewed vertically, rather than horizontally
	  and by the wrong amoung.
	<LI>
	  When doing a font sample from a script which did not set the page width/height
	  explicitly, then ff would use a size of 0 for each. All text drawn was out
	  of the imaging area, lines were too short (as well as invisible), too many
	  pages (all blank).
	<LI>
	  Barry points out that "print" is a python keyword. So font.print() doesn't
	  work. Call it printSample() instead.
	<LI>
	  Freetype now (or in the next release, 2.3.7) supports dropout modes, which
	  means fontforge must do a bit of work when generating rasters for the debugger.
	<LI>
	  Move some logic out of fontimage.pe and into fontforge to make a default
	  string for a font image more widely available.
	<LI>
	  When saving an image fromt the print dlg, the top line was off the top of
	  the image.
	<LI>
	  Interpolated points need not be on integral boundaries, but ff was checking
	  for them. Different problems in validator and find problems, but both wrong.
	<LI>
	  In the point near hint check (find problems), ff was leaving the hint selected.
	<LI>
	  Fix some rounding errors in spline/line intersection.
	<LI>
	  in Font Info, after user pressed [OK] FF set the state of the subscript
	  superscript default checkbox to the panose default checkbox by mistake. This
	  means if the user defined panose and not sub/super garbage would appear in
	  the OS/2 sub/super fields.
	<LI>
	  fontimage didn't get the script right, so features weren't applied properly.
	<LI>
	  More work on conflicting stems.
	<LI>
	  Pressing [Done] in the print dialog would right to a random address on the
	  stack. Depending on what was going on when this was done it could cause a
	  crash.
	<LI>
	  Fix an uninitialized variable introduced by the last change to order2 conversion.
	<LI>
	  Add the ability to open an archive and peek inside it for fonts. Useful if
	  we want to open stuff from the open font library which is often packaged
	  in zip files.
	<LI>
	  Add a new validation check to see if a glyph has non-integral coordinates.
	  Only an error in TrueType (and can't happen when fontlinting a truetype file,
	  but could happen on an sfd file). Add some logic to ask user if they intend
	  to generate truetype in cases where we aren't sure.
	<LI>
	  Add a preference which allows people to change the pixmap dir -- and do what
	  we can to reload images from the new dir. Some old windows may not be updated,
	  but new ones should reflect the new stuff.
	<LI>
	  When ff changed the name of a glyph, it fixed up all the tabs in charviews
	  to the new name -- but in neglected to refresh them. So they still showed
	  on the screen with the old name (until something forced a refresh).
	<LI>
	  The Anchor Class dialog (which lists all anchor classes of a subtable) only
	  let you create an Anchor Control dialog for the first anchor class.
	<LI>
	  Guard (harder) against generating pathological results when converting cubic
	  to quadratic splines.
	<LI>
	  If we had a spline which almost doubled back on itself, sufficiently so that
	  the spline intersector found lots of really close points, which it called
	  intersections, but not sufficiently so that our colinear detector caught
	  it, then we'd generate a ton of intersections, overflow certain arrays, and
	  trash the stack. =&gt; ff would crash. I didn't think this could happen,
	  until someone provided a test case, so put in guards against this.
	<LI>

	  Trying to build dieresis with "PreferSpacingAccents" set meant that we tried
	  to build it out of itself, and crashed.

	  Also fix so that 0x22EF (ellipsis variant) is built out of centered dot in

	  Provide a mechanism for loading image files to make menu item icons (instead

	  <P>
	  The big change in this release is that every font database can now contain
	  multiple layers. Before this all layers in a font used the same type of splines
	  and there were only 2 or 3 of them.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Guideline semi-layer -- where all the glyphs of the font shared the same
	      set of outlines, to which points would snap if desired.
	    <LI>
	      A background layer -- which could contain outlines and also images which
	      could be autotraced into the foreground layer.
	    <LI>
	      A foreground layer -- which was what the font really looked like, and what
	      went into generated fonts
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  Now there may be any number of layers, and each layer can contain different
	  types of splines -- so one database can contain both quadratic and cubic
	  data and can store data for both PostScript and TrueType fonts.
	  <P>
	  In a normal font all glyphs have the same number of layers (this is not true
	  in a type3 font, which each glyph may have it's own set of layers). You may
	  set the number, names and types of layers width the <CODE>Element-&gt;Font
	  Info-&gt;Layers</CODE> pane.
	  <P>
	  In the font view you can select which layer is active (and displayed) with
	  the <CODE>View-&gt;Layers</CODE> menu item. You can copy selected glyphs
	  of one layer to another (automagically adjusting the spline type if needed)
	  with <CODE>Edit-&gt;Copy Layer To Layer</CODE>. You can compare to layers
	  for differences with <CODE>Element-&gt;Compare Layers...</CODE>.
	  <P>
	  In the character view the Layers palette has changed. The things which controlled
	  the visibility of hints have moved to the <CODE>View-&gt;Show</CODE> menu
	  (as have some other entries that used to be in the top level
	  <CODE>View</CODE> menu). The layers palette solely displays the glyph's layers
	  and controls which layer is active.
	  <P>
	  The <CODE>File-&gt;Generate Fonts...</CODE> dialog allows you to specify
	  which layer is to go into the font. Note that many things remain common:
	  the hints and truetype instructions apply to all layers. GPOS, GSUB, kern,
	  and morx information is common all layers. The outlines may differ in detail,
	  but outlines from which a font will be generated should have the same shape.
	  <P>
	  Add new python stuff to handle layers:
	  <DL>
	    <DT>
	      fontforge.activeLayer()
	    <DD>
	      Returns the currently active layer
	    <DT>
	      font.layer_cnt
	    <DD>
	      Returns the number of layers in the font
	    <DT>
	      font.layers
	    <DD>
	      A dictionary like object which can be indexed either by an integer between
	      0 (inclusive) and layer_cnt (exclusive) or by the name of a layer. After
	      indexing it returns a LayerInfo object. LayerInfo objects have no independant
	      existance, and contain a layer's name and a boolean indicating whether the
	      layer is_quadratic.

	  M.P. Suzuki requests a way to load the entire 'glyf' table of a ttc. Actually

	  kinds of problems (multiple fpgm, prep, maxp, cvt tables, trying to fix up
	  GIDs in GPOS/GSUB/kern/* tables, dealing with fonts with so many glyphs they

	  Add a command Points-&gt;Make Arc, which is similar to Points-&gt;Make Line
	  except that it connects the two points with an elliptical arc rather than
	  a straight line. The ellipse is choosen to run through the two points (obviously)
	  and to be tangent to the slope of those points. This isn't enough information
	  to determine an ellipse uniquely (three points and two tangents being required)
	  so in general there will be an infinite number of solutions (and it is possible
	  to provide contradictory input so that no ellipse can be found). FontForge
	  may not choose the ellipse you had your heart set on. FF will first attempt
	  to find an ellipse so that one of the points lies on an axis of the ellipse
	  (this will find a circle if there is a circle which satisfies the constraints
	  above). If that fails it will look more generally for ellipses.
	  <P>
	  (If you hold down the &lt;Alt&gt; key when you select the menu item, FF will
	  leave the ellipse it calculated in the background layer. That was a debugging

	  FontForge uses floats (which have ~24 bits of precision internally) to represent

	  during output and input of a font. Unfortunately, due to the rel-rel nature
	  of postscript these slight errors accumulate.
	  <P>
	  So instead, when loading and saving a Type2 font use double precision

	  It used to be that when a font had both 'mor[tx]' and 'GSUB' we would only
	  read 'GSUB'. But Michel Boyer wanted to read both. So... read 'morx' after
	  'GSUB' and if we find a feature/setting that looks as though it corresponds
	  to an existing OpenType lookup (which we can convert to a Mac format) then
	  skip that feature/setting, presuming it to contain redundant data.
	  <P>
	  This is a finer grain approach, but similar to, the previous one. There we

	  * I no longer have separate l/lpotential and r/rpotential pairs &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  of point data objects. Instead I use just 'l' and 'r' accompanied by
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; boolean flags indicating their state as "potential". This greatly
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; simplifies some tests and makes the code more readable. * When
	  I am adding a chunk based on a single point to an existing stem, &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  I always mark the second point as "potential". Later this state can
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; be changed if check based on the second point produces the
	  same chunk, &Acirc;&nbsp; or at least doesn't produce another (conflicting)
	  stem. Again, this &Acirc;&nbsp; simplifies some tests which accompany adding
	  new chunks and makes the &Acirc;&nbsp; result of the stem detection less
	  dependent from the order in which &Acirc;&nbsp; the points are processed.
	  * I allow assigning a point to a stem even when its distance from the
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; stem edge is larger than standard dist_error_hv or dist_error_diag,
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; if only the difference between maximum possible deviations
	  to the &Acirc;&nbsp; both sides of the edge doesn't exceed the double
	  dist_error_* value. &Acirc;&nbsp; This prevents us from adding several
	  almost-coincident hints, actually &Acirc;&nbsp; controlling the same stem.
	  * I have added a function which performs some stem normalization, &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  sorting chunks by point coordinates. For HV stems it also can &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  slightly modify the positioning of the stem edges preferring the &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  coordinate which is closer to most points assigned to each edge. * There
	  is now a special function used to compare conflicting stems &Acirc;&nbsp;
	  and decide if one of these two should be preferred, or they both are
	  &Acirc;&nbsp; worth to be output. * The detection of serifs and similar elements,
	  which, not being &Acirc;&nbsp; exactly horizontal/vertical, still have to
	  be marked with a HV &Acirc;&nbsp; stem, has been improved (two points, forming
	  a serif termination, &Acirc;&nbsp; now should not necessarily follow each

	  Oops. A font member in python was mis-named. Documented to be "loadState"
	  was "loadStyle". Corrected to match the documentation.
	<LI>
	  Some of the 'maxp' checks in the validator were off by 1, so fontlint would

	<LI>
	  Validator was checking non-composite glyphs against composite boundries.
	<LI>
	  Barry Schwartz points out that I should validate the PostScript Private

	  Further improvements to the auto instructor.
	<LI>
	  When all glyphs are selected and the user auto-instructs, then FontForge
	  will clear any legacy tables ('fpgm', 'prep' and 'cvt&nbsp;'). The old values
	  will be of no use, and they just get in the way.
	<LI>
	  Add a Edit-&gt;Select-&gt;Select by Script command<BR>
	  Make the Select by Name take a wildcard (so you could select "*.sc").
	<LI>
	  ApplySubstitutions still had problems. Caused crashes in a font with
	  instructions.
	<LI>
	  If one used the metrics view to create a kerning lookup then: there would
	  be no 'kern' feature in the feature list yet, and the display would randomly
	  lose track of kern pairs and then create new ones. Very confusing.
	<LI>
	  Hmm. In some cases Merge Fonts didn't copy over lookup info.<BR>
	  Add the ability to merge cross-font kerning pairs (in case the two fonts
	  being merged have the same glyphs for those which are in both fonts).
	<LI>
	  Provide a mass glyph rename menu item.
	<LI>
	  The [Merge] button in Font Info-&gt;Lookups was disabled when two subtables

	  If a glyph ended in a suffix (one.superior, etc.), then changes to that glyph
	  were not reflected in the fontview.
	<LI>
	  Add the ability to Populate a lookup from the selection (in the lookup sub-table
	  dialogs)<BR>
	  Do a better job of providing default values for single substitutions &amp;
	  positions.
	<LI>
	  In the Print/Display dlg, deleting something so that the next line was blank

	  In Italic/Oblique fonts (those where the font has an italic angle specified)
	  make the center in width command correct for the italic angle.
	<LI>
	  Round to Int didn't round anchor points.

	  Inkscape stuffs bitmap images into svg files using the data URI<BR>
	  &nbsp; &nbsp;data:&lt;mimetype&gt;,&lt;data&gt;<BR>

	  <P>
	  So, I'll support this now as my only way of handling type3 style svg fonts
	  with embedded bitmaps.
	  <P>
	  The standard points out that URIs are limited to 1024 bytes, but I don't
	  pay any attention to that restriction, and will stuff arbetrary sized images
	  into these things.
	<LI>
	  The code that set up python import/export filters did not put an end of list
	  entry after the last one. Sometimes it would be NULL (correct) and things
	  would work and sometimes it would be garbage and things would crash.
	<LI>
	  Drat. In the outline glyph view, the Import command didn't set the filter
	  properly when you changed the import type.
	<LI>
	  Extend fontforge to keep track of errors encountered when loading 'sfnt'
	  files, and then have fontlint complain about them.
	  <P>
	  Also extend fontlint to do validity checking in glyphs against the 'maxp'
	  table. (This won't matter when editing fonts, as ff will fixup the maxp values
	  when it generates the font, but there might be some existing fonts with buggy
	  'maxp' values).
	<LI>
	  Oops. When changing the weight of a glyph and retaining the counter sizes,
	  fontforge would push two entries onto the undo stack rather than one. (So
	  the user would have to do Edit-&gt;Undo twice to get back to where s/he started
	  from).
	<LI>
	  Added several new python methods to font.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      find(contour) will search the font for all glyphs containing contour and
	      return an interator on that set.
	    <LI>
	      replaceAll(srch,rpl) Will search for the "srch" contour/layer in the font
	      and replace it (each time it occurs) with the "rpl" contour/layer.
	    <LI>
	      glyphs(type) returns an iterator over all glyphs in the font. If present
	      type may be "GID" (default if omitted) or "encoding" and it indicates the
	      order in which the glyphs will be returned.
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  Added some new members to glyph:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      encoding -- returns the glyph's encoding in the font

	  Try a different algorithm for approximating splines by line segments (for
	  drawing them in the outline glyph view and elsewhere). This one should show
	  symmetry better.
	<LI>
	  Provide the ability to ask freetype to rasterize glyphs without hints in
	  the Print/Display dlg (even if the glyphs have hints, rasterize them without).

	  Oh dear, rasterizing stroked fonts only worked if multilayer was defined.

	  Add a short cut for Hide Grid in the metrics view.
	<LI>
	  Python 2.5 initializes itself differently from Python 2.[34]. 2.[34] delay
	  the init until an import happens, while 2.5 does it at start up. I just assumed
	  that when I called Py_Initialize that it did so. This led to a crash on 2.[34]
	  when I tried to use my types before the user had tried to import fontforge.
	<LI>
	  Further improvements to tile path.
	<LI>
	  When moving a control point in a ttf font where one side of the cp was a

	  The knife tool would not cut a contour if it landed on a point.

	  I don't think feature files where handling classes defined with '-' properly.
	<LI>
	  Read the "lib" structures from UFO/GLIF files into our python persistent

	<LI>
	  Add the ability to call hooks (python functions) when various fontforge events
	  take place.
	<LI>
	  Make fontforge's basic types (Point, Contour, and Layer) be picklable so
	  they can now be saved in an sfd file.
	<LI>
	  Oops. With the inclusion of the library check argument, ff would not compile
	  if NODYNAMIC were set.
	<LI>
	  FontForge now stores the "userdata" python members into the sfd file as pickled
	  objects. (FontForge's own types are not currently pickleable).
	<LI>
	  Add the ability to mark a glyph so that just before being saved its references
	  will be unlinked and we will run remove overlap on it. This means the user
	  can work with the references (and get the automatic updating they confer)
	  and still not have a self-intersecting glyph in the output (think Aring,
	  Ccedilla, Eogonek).
	<LI>
	  Create a fontlint script file.
	<LI>
	  When dumping both apple and opentype bitmap tables if there were a BDF table,
	  then we'd get garbage for 'bloc'/'bhed'.
	<LI>
	  Add some user interface commands to python, and more importantly, add the
	  ability to create menu items which will invoke python scripts, and the ability
	  to add import/export conversion filters (again, python scripts).
	<LI>
	  Counter hints for LCG glyphs came out wrong if autohint had not been applied
	  first.
	<LI>
	  Counter masks were not read out of sfd files properly.

	  Fix two memory leaks in the metrics view (one was huge).

	  If freetype failed to rasterize a glyph, then we would fall back on returning

	  If we were given a cff (otf) font, with a bluevalues array which ended in

	  I have merged (and substantially rewritten) the Print and Display Dialogs.
	  There is now only one menu item (Print) which (vaguely) the old Display dlg
	  except that it can now be printed. The text area widget now supports OpenType
	  features just as the metrics view does. It also supports ligature carets.
	  <P>
	  The dialog is no longer modal, however it does not get updated with each
	  change to the font (that would make moving a point around in the outline
	  view far too sluggish), instead there is a [Refresh] button the user can
	  press to force an update.
	<LI>
	  It occurred to me that fontforge's current mechanism for setting ligature
	  carets requires that there be a ligature substitution is the exact number
	  of components used to make the glyph. But in indic fonts ligatures are often
	  made up out of other ligatures (I think) which means that there won't be
	  enough caret positions.
	  <P>
	  So I've added a Ligature Caret count to the Element-&gt;Glyph Info dialog
	  to give the user control over it when necessary.
	<LI>
	  Add minimal support for applying apple state machine lookups in metrics view.
	  Support is minimal because:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Apple seems to figure line breaks before doing substitution process but I
	      do it afterward so I don't know where the line breaks are and I can't enter
	      either the line start or line end state.
	    <LI>
	      When I delete a glyph I delete it. Apple inserts a deleted glyph mark and
	      then removes that later. State machines can respond to deleted glyphs, but
	      I can't.
	    <LI>
	      I don't try to figure out which feature,settings should be on by default.
	      So the user must pick them out manually.
	  </UL>
	<LI>
	  Add popup graphics to the Glyph Info and Lookup subtable dialogs to show
	  substitutions (that is if there is an entry like 'smcp' a =&gt; a.sc then
	  create a popup window showing the "a" glyph and the "a.sc" so the user can
	  see what happens.
	<LI>
	  Another futile attempt at an embolden command. Element-&gt;Embolden
	<LI>
	  Add shortcuts to the anchor control dlg (Page Up/Page Down) to move to the

	<LI>
	  Michal Nowakowski has improved the truetype autoinstructor. He warns that
	  it probably still has bugs (as what does not?) so I am leaving the old code
	  available for now. He says it works best in "a clean (uninstructed) font
	  with well defined blue zones and stems".
	<LI>
	  If we have a glyph with multiple encodings, and the secondary encodings occur
	  after the primary ones, then the backmap will probably contain a secondary
	  encoding, which means that when we go to load the font in we will probably
	  notice the secondary encoding twice and forget the primary.
	<LI>
	  I used not to distinguish between ligature anchors and normal mark to base
	  anchors. Unfortunately when I moved to lookups (from features) I had to introduce
	  that distinction. But I didn't work through all the implications and have
	  fixed a number of bugs related to that.
	<LI>
	  Barry SCHWARTZ complains that font info says "fontnames must" but that the

	  If the user did not select a Gasp Version (note: active selection was needed,

	  I've redone the way FontForge handles lookups so that it is more in keeping
	  with OpenType.
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	    The major change is that fontforge now presents lookups to the user rather
	    than features. I think this makes simple things more difficult (which is
	    why I avoided this when I started), but it makes complex things possible.
	    <P>
	    Sadly the world is not simple.
	    <P>
	    So when a piece of typographic information is created (a ligature, a kern
	    pair, a glyph substitution, etc.) it must be tagged with a lookup (actually
	    a lookup sub-table) rather than a feature tag.
	    <P>
	    The lookup itself will be tagged with a feature tag (possibly several tags)
	    and with scripts and languages in which that lookup should be active.<BR>
	    <STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> This reverses the way GPOS/GSUB think about things,
	    but it contains the same information.
	    <P>
	    The <A href="fontinfo.html#Lookups">Font Info</A> dialog now contains a Lookup
	    pane which allows you to create and edit lookups and their subtables. You
	    can also reorder them. The order shown in the dialog is the order in which
	    they will be applied.
	    <P>
	    A mac feature/setting subtable also gets converted into this format.
	    <P>
	    The Font Info dialog no longer has Anchor Classes, Contextual, or State Machine
	    panes.
	    <P>
	    Instead you can edit a lookup subtable's data (for any subtable type). There
	    are new dialogs which list all the information for each lookup type (ie.
	    a dialog which lists all kern pairs in a subtable), and these provide access
	    to the old anchor class, contextual or state machine dialogs.
	    <P>
	    The Glyph Info command has also changed. It looks simpler and more comprehensible
	    (I think), but the act of creating a new substitution has become more complex
	    because (potentially) one must create a new lookup and lookup subtable before
	    doing the simple task of adding a new replacement glyph.
	    <P>
	    The kerning class, contextual and state machine dialogs have all changed
	    in that they no longer request a feature tag, they now need a lookup subtable.
	    <P>
	    The metrics view also needs a subtable.<BR>
	    The metrics view has changed considerably.<BR>
	    It displays all the features in the font, and allows you to select which
	    ones you want active in the view. It lets you set the script &amp; language.
	    It will apply lookups that it couldn't handle previously like ligatures and
	    contextuals.
	    <P>
	    It does not do Indic glyph reordering. I'm not sure how to and last I checked
	    MS had not updated their docs to reflect their new procedures.
	    <P>
	    Many other dialogs now take a lookup subtable where appropriate.
	    <P>
	    Show ATT has changed, but it is still not editable. I hope that the Lookups
	    pane will do that instead.
	    <P>
	    There used to be a scripting command which indicated what ligature features
	    got stored in afm files. Now each ligature lookup has a flag set on it which
	    conveys this information.
	    <P>
	    The Element-&gt;Typographic Features menu has been removed. It's functionality
	    has moved into Font Info-&gt;Lookups (I hope I've got everything).
	    <P>
	    Some scripting commands have been removed, others have been changed and others
	    have been added. I apologize for this, as it will break existing scripts,
	    but some basic concepts no longer exist and others, very different, have

	  I have received many complaints about the grey background, so I have tried
	  various other backgrounds -- and gotten complaints on all of them. Currently
	  try using a white background by default and add a
	  <A HREF="faq.html#background">discussion in the FAQ</A> about changing it.
	<LI>
	  Add support for Unified Font Objects (a directory holding many Glyph Interchange
	  Format files). People at the Open Font Library seem to think this is useful.
	  Also support for importing/exporting glyphs in glif.
	<LI>
	  People asked me to implement the UFO/GLIF format in part because each glyph
	  is stored in a separate file giving finer granularity to version control.
	  I worry about using UFO/GLIF because it is not documented to store all the
	  information needed to regenerate a font (being mainly concerned with glyph
	  outlines). So I've implemented a directory based version of the sfd format
	  which I hope will provide the one glyph per file format people say they want.

	  MS has extended the 'gasp' table to give users control over clear type. Version

	  Werner doesn't like that I always add dummy bitmaps for .notdef, .null &amp;
	  nonmarkingreturn. It seemed logical to me that if I were prepared to add
	  those glyphs to the outline font I should be prepared to add them to the
	  bitmap strike. But Werner (I think) sees bitmap strikes as containing exceptional
	  glyphs which need special handling, whereas I just saw them as complete fonts.
	  So in this context I guess there is no need to add these glyphs. As a compromise
	  I have decided that I will add the glyphs to the bitmap strike if I added
	  the glyphs to the outline font.

	  When Adobe first released fonts with a 'size' feature they did not follow

	  A few of Adobe's programs make use of the 'size' feature, and XeTeX does.
	  I know of no others (besides font editors). Both intend to upgrade their

	  Philipp Poll points out that ScaleToEm doesn't scale the OS/2 metrics (and

	  (which essentially has a 64k data limit or a bit more than 10,000 kern pairs).
	  So be prepared to generate many sub-tables each dealing with a subset of
	  the (first) glyphs.

	  Merge fonts didn't merge anchors and got into a terrible mess. Let's merge
	  kern classes and state machines too. Merging kern classes may be a bad idea.
	  We don't really merge them we just copy them so that if the same glyph is
	  mentioned in two classes unexpected things might happen.
	<LI>
	  ff could crash on an sfd file containing erroneous anchors (such as might
	  be generated by the merge fonts command).
	<LI>
	  Once upon a time, Apple was so concerned about accuracy of floating point
	  operations that they required all operations be performed in IEEE extended
	  (80bit). This had the interesting side effect that a program which conformed
	  to Apple's standards could not also conform to ANSI C (which required operations
	  use double temporaries for double values). I find it somewhat ironic, therefore,
	  that gcc on the mac doesn't even promote floats to doubles. FF needs the
	  extra accuracy provided by a double (an extended type doesn't seem to provide
	  additional assistance unfortunately). So on the mac we got extrema that weren't,
	  which meant that remove overlap didn't.
	<LI>
	  If we had a mac feature which had multiple subtables (ie. a state machine

	  Add a "Revert to Backup" command.

	  If we had a font with no complete code pages we used to generate a version

	<LI>
	  Johan Winge also points out that I identify points as tangents when they
	  should not be. This is because I use one measure of sloppiness no matter

	  best to have a variable measure depending on how far the cp is from the base

	  It used to be that we didn't set the default background until the first font

	  In MultiLayered mode, the "New Layer" menu item left a dangling pointer which
	  caused a crash if anyone looked at the background layer.
	<LI>
	  In MultiLayered mode, if one clicked beyond the last layer in the Layers
	  palette, ff would crash.
	<LI>
	  KANOU provided a patch to fix another crash in the layers palette.
	<LI>
	  KANOU has provided a new Japanese UI.
	<LI>
	  Made an addition to CharInfo() scripting command so user can determine the
	  horizontal extrema of a glyph at a given vertical position. Similar addition
	  for vertical extrema at horizontal pos.
	<LI>
	  Add a scripting command (PasteWithOffset) to allow user to apply an offset
	  when pasting. For building accented letters by hand.
	<LI>
	  KANOU provides a patch to fix a problem in the new encoding stuff.
	<LI>

	  Kanou noticed that ISO 15924 has been updated and provide a patch including
	  new scripts.
	<LI>
	  I have redone the way ff handles encodings internally. We used to depend
	  on the encodings builtin to gdraw/gunicode. Now we use iconv() (if there
	  is no iconv, then ff will use a dummy iconv which understands the encodings
	  of gdraw/gunicode). Encodings are identified by name rather than by number
	  now.
	<LI>
	  Further fixes to the extremum detector
	<LI>
	  Further fixes to remove overlap
	<LI>
	  Added an extra argument to scripting RoundToInt, so that you can have control
	  over what it rounds to (ie. round to hundredths, tenths, etc.)
	<LI>
	  Added two new scripting commands NearlyHvCps() and NearlyHvLines() which
	  look for control points or lines that are nearly horizontal or vertical and
	  force them to be horizontal or vertical.
	<LI>
	  Kanou provided a patch so that the GRadio.Font resource controls the font
	  in the layers palette of the glyph view.

	  Remove overlap had problems with splines which made abrupt turns (ie. tiny
	  splines after we found extrema points and divided the spline into bits between
	  extrema)
	<LI>
	  Remove overlap could munch memory
	<LI>
	  The ruler tool showed all tiny splines as having a length of 0
	<LI>
	  Autorecovery had problems with glyphs containing features (would complain
	  about sli)
	<LI>
	  KANOU wants to be able to scale greymap fonts

	  removed routines from fvcomposit.c, metricsview.c that were duplicates of

	  Support for loading type3 fonts (that ff produced) was broken. Note: ff is
	  still unable to load many type3 fonts (any that are filtered, or that use
	  images for example), but it should be able to read its own fonts.
	<LI>
	  (I hope) minor change to the way .notdef is handled when reading postscript

	  Fixed various problems from turning off the multilayer bit in fontinfo
	<LI>
	  KANOU needs a couple more strings disambiguated.
	<LI>
	  Add support for generating type42 and type 11 (type42 cid) fonts, add support
	  for loading type42 (but I'm not bothering with type11s) and use these guys
	  when printing order2 fonts.
	<LI>
	  Check to make sure the PostScript Fontname is valid when reading in a truetype

	  Add some new scripting commands for handling MM fonts since someone seems
	  to want them.
	<LI>
	  Used to complain if there were more than one Unique Font ID in the truetype
	  'name' table. (because the OpenType list said there should only be one, else
	  it would not be unique). But both Apple and MS ship with fonts containing
	  multiple Unique Font IDs. God knows what that means, or when you pick one
	  over the other... Anyway I changed my error into a warning.

	  I have rewritten Remove Overlap from scratch. I seems less likely to crash,
	  but I'm not sure that in any other respect it is improved.
	<LI>
	  In the character view the Remove Overlap (and Intersect and Find Intersections)
	  now only work on selected contours, or, if no contours are selected then
	  on all contours. This change makes these commands consistant with most other
	  commands in the character view, but it is a change from past behavior.
	<LI>
	  The Import scripting command has been extended to give the user control over
	  the stroking flags (correct direction, remove overlap, handle erasers). And
	  the background flag has been extended a bit to apply to other things than
	  bitmaps.
	<LI>
	  ff had a pointer dangling to a freed block after loading a font containing
	  multiple versions of some greek letters.
	<LI>
	  U+1D400-U+1D7FF are stylized variants of the latin and greek alphabets as
	  used in Mathematics. The font view will now display (in the glyph header)
	  the proper variant of the glyph (assuming it can find a font with that style).
	<LI>
	  The AMS (American Mathematical Society) has their own interpretation of the
	  public use area. FF now understands their glyph names as alternates for those
	  glyphs, and has an AMS interpretation (under FontInfo-&gt;Encoding) that
	  will make ff use those names in new fonts.
	<LI>
	  Many of code points in the AMS PUA are reencodings of other glyphs. FontForge
	  will automatically generate these reencodings for you.
	<LI>
	  The AMS also describes how some TeX glyph names map to unicode. So include
	  those names in our alternate list too (so we can map them correctly, not
	  as a way of encouraging people to use them).
	<LI>
	  Both the AMS defn. of the PUA and the Big5 defn. map characters which are
	  properly in other unicode planes into the BMP. FF now understands this, and
	  converting between a BMP encoding and a full unicode encoding will move things
	  from the PUA to their proper unicode slot in higher planes.
	<LI>
	  Find Problems thought that adjacent splines intersected at their common
	  end-point. I suppose they do, but it isn't useful information
	<LI>
	  In the char view, I used to blank out the status line when the mouse moved
	  outside the window. But some of that info is still valid. So only blank out
	  the meaningless bits.
	<LI>
	  Kanou requests a disambiguation between two strings with the same label in
	  English but different meanings in Japanese. (Vertical/VerticalWriting)
	<LI>
	  The Point-&gt;Make Line command would crash if either of the two points
	  was missing a previous or next spline.
	<LI>
	  Pierre HANSER provides a patch to problems.c (it would crash when dealing
	  with fonts with an encoding with &lt; 32 code points.
	<LI>
	  Pierre HANSER provides a patch to merge fonts (it would crash when merging
	  bitmap fonts.
	<LI>
	  Closing a charview window with a docked palette could cause a crash if the
	  cursor was moved quickly into another charview which needed a new cursor.
	<LI>
	  The perspective icon had the wrong background
	<LI>
	  Piska keeps complaining about the way ff handles 0 width strokes. He wants
	  it to have zero width (disappear, I guess), but PS says it should be stroked
	  as the thinnest line possible (not clear what this should mean in ff, I interpret
	  it as a 1em-unit stroke). But METAPOST uses a 0 width stroke in cases where
	  it wants no stroking (with a fill) so in the special case of a fill with
	  a 0 width stroke, turn off stroking.
	<LI>
	  Use a different approach to approximating a set of points with fixed slopes
	  at the end points. Used to do least squares (fixup slopes), least squares
	  again (fixup slopes). Now I do least squares (fixup slopes), perturb the
	  lengths of the slope vectors until we find the best fit.
	<LI>
	  I was generating flex hints when I should not have done so. Add a heuristic
	  so that ff doesn't add flexes to small circles.

	  The SetPanose scripting command didn't work. MURAOKA Taro provides a patch
	<LI>
	  It was not possible to get or set NewCharset preference item with GetPref/SetPref

	<LI>
	  If you copied a glyph feature from a glyph that didn't have that feature,

	  Added two new tools to the outline character view. One allows you to rotated
	  your glyph through 3dimensions (and project it back on the xy plane), the
	  other allows you to do a perspective transformation.
	<LI>
	  Extended the Transformation dialog to handle 3D rotation+projection. After

	  There was a path through LoadEncodingFile (in a script) where it would silently

	  LoadEncodingFile would save default encodings even though it hadn't loaded

	  When the width is huge, then moving it causes it to wrap into negative values.

	  FontForge had problems when the fontview was maximized.

	  The 18-Apr patch for cubic-&gt;quadratic conversion had a bug which generally

	  When flickering in and out of compacted mode, during a Generate Fonts, the

	  Oops. Can do much better converting from cubic to quadratic splines. We were

	<LI>
	  Our cubic-&gt;quadratic conversion could generate splines where the endpoints
	  were less than 1 unit apart. Since ttf rounds all coords to ints, this meant

	  Bug in both reading and writing encoding format 0 of cff fonts. I forgot

	  If a glyph was used as a reference in another glyph, and we put it in a

	  In multilayered mode, the Revert Glyph command left memory in a potentially

	  When loading a mac contextual substitution statemachine, fontforge made egregious

	  Werner found a strange bug in splinefill that I can't reproduce (and can't
	  understand how it could happen) but the fix appears obvious.
	<LI>
	  Add a command to show what glyphs use the current glyph in a substitution
	  (so "A.swash" would show that "A" used it, and "i" would show that "fi" used
	  it).
	<LI>
	  Changed the extension shown in the Generate Fonts dlg for multiple saves
	  to ".pfb". Put in a %s to make it obvious that more will be added to the

  FontForge was first released on 2-Mar-2004. An earlier version of the program,
  called PfaEdit, was begun in Sept of 2000, released on the web 7-Nov-2000,
  and moved to pfaedit.sf.net on 21-Apr-2001.
