#. This file allows you to change FontForge’s menu shortcuts. It is a gettext\
#.  based system, which means it is locale dependent.\
#.\
#. These entries are formatted as follows:\
#.  First we have the (English) name of the command as it appears in\
#.      the menu.\
#.  Then we have a "|" (which is used as a separator)\
#.  Finally we have the shortcut for the command as a textual string.\
#.\
#. If you wish to change a shortcut simply provide its textual representation\
#.  in the msgstr field. So if you want the shortcut for New Outline Window\
#.  to be Ctl+O\
#.        msgid "New Outline Window|Ctl+H"\
#.        msgstr "Ctl+O"\
#. (NOTE: You should NOT include "New Outline Window|" in your msgstr)\
#. If you wish to remove a shortcut\
#.        msgid "New Outline Window|Ctl+H"\
#.        msgstr "No Shortcut"\
#. If you wish to use a function key (or similar)\
#.        msgid "New Outline Window|Ctl+H"\
#.        msgstr "F2"\
#. or\
#.        msgid "New Outline Window|Ctl+H"\
#.        msgstr "Backspace"\
#.\
#. You may apply one or several modifiers to shortcuts. FontForge recognizes:\
#.   Ctl+   Shft+    Alt+   CapsLock+\
#. Some keyboards have additional modifier keys, X maps them to a flag bit in\
#.  the keyboard state mask of the XKeyEvent. If you want to use these modifiers\
#.  you need to know what that bit is. FontForge will also recognize:\
#.    Flag0x01+   Flag0x02+   Flag0x04+  Flag0x08+\
#.    Flag0x10+   Flag0x20+   Flag0x40+  Flag0x80+\
#. (I can’t come up with better names than these because in general\
#.  I don’t know what they are myself).\
#. The mac has two additional modifier keys: Command and Option\
#.  X never gets the Command key (or rather the X application’s menubar gets\
#.  it and client programs never see it) so we can’t use it.\
#.  But clients can get at the Option key and FontForge recognizes\
#.     Opt+\
#.\
#. So...\
#.        msgid "New Outline Window|Ctl+H"\
#.        msgstr "Ctl+Shft+Alt+Flag10+Opt+F2"\
#. would be practically untypeable, but syntactically valid.\
#.\
#. When FF displays a shortcut in the menu it will use a similar syntax.\
#. That may not be appropriate for non-English terminals. On a French system\
#.  it might be better to show the Shift modifier as Majuscule. At the bottom of\
#.  this file are several entries which are not used to set shortcuts but are\
#.  used in displaying the shortcuts in the menu, thus\
#.      #: ../gdraw/gmenu.c:120\
#.      msgid "Shft+"\
#.      msgstr "Maj+"\
#.\
#. Even though not obvious from this file, it is also possible to add names for\
#.  special keys. So you could add:\
#.      msgid "Escape"\
#.      msgstr "Échappe"\
#.      msgid "Delete"\
#.      msgstr "Efface"\
#. (or whatever is appropriate for keyboards)\
#.\
#. The English names accepted are those defined under XK_MISCELLANY in\
#.  keysymdef.h of the X11 header files -- without the initial XK_\
#.\
#.\
#. I am told that the use of "|" to provide contextual information in a\
#. gettext string is non-standard. However it is documented in section\
#. 10.2.6 of http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_mono/gettext.html\
#. I need it, and I will use it.\
