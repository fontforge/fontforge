<H1 Style="text-align:center"> Expand Stroke Facility </H1>

<P> The Expand Stroke facility traces a closed, convex contour (referred to as
the "nib") along a "source" contour, producing a new contour or contours that
enclose the area the nib "passed over". When the source contour is open the
result is usually a single closed contour, and when the source contour is
closed the result is usually two closed contours:

<figure><object data="stroke/typical.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="80%" class="svgfig">Typical Examples</object></figure>

<P> There are exceptions when the geometry of the nib and the source contour
interact:

<figure><object data="stroke/exceptional.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="70%" class="svgfig">Unusual Examples</object></figure>

<P> The "Expand Stroke..." dialog in the "Element" menu of a font view or
outline view window is the primary interactive interface for the facility.  In
the font view it traces all foreground contours in all selected glyphs.  In the
outline view it traces all contours with at least one point selected, or every
contour if no points are selected on any contour.  The dialog looks like this:

<figure><img src="stroke/dialog_1x.png" srcset="stroke/dialog_3x.png 3x, stroke/dialog_2x.png 2x, stroke/dialog_1x.png 1x" alt="Expand Stroke Dialog" class="imgfig"></figure>

<P> The <A HREF="charview.html#freehand">Freehand Tool</A> also uses the
facility and has a similar dialog, and there are interfaces for both
<A HREF="python.html#glyph-stroke">Python</A> and
<A HREF="scripting-alpha.html#ExpandStroke">FontForge's native scripting 
language</A>.

<P> This guide is arranged into three sections. The
<A HREF="#offsetting">first</A> discusses the common case of tracing
a circular nib, which is also called "offsetting". It includes a description
of the "<A HREF="#cap">cap</A>" and "<A HREF="#join">join</A>" options for
offset curves.

<P> The <A HREF="#nibs">second section</A> introduces the other nibs types: the
rectangular "calligraphic" nibs associated with some types of calligraphy,
elliptical nibs, and general convex nibs designed by the user.  All nibs
support the same cap and join options listed in the first section, but some
have slightly different behaviors and effects.

<P> The <A HREF="#parameters">last section</A> discusses additional parameters
that address special cases, influence the geometric accuracy of the generated
contours, or that can aid in debugging potential problems.

<H2 id="offsetting">Offsetting</H2>

Tracing a contour with a circular nib of radius <em>r</em> is equivalent to
"offsetting"—creating parallel contours on each side at distance <em>r</em> for
a total line thickness of <em>2r</em> (source contour shown in green):

<figure><object data="stroke/offsets.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="70%" class="svgfig">Offset Curves</object></figure>

<P> In FontForge you specify a circular nib in the UI dialog by choosing the
"Circular/Elliptical" nib type and making the Major and Minor Axis lengths
equal. In the native and Python API a Minor Axis value of zero will be
replaced by the Major Axis value. And although it does not make a geometric
difference, the recommended Nib Angle for a Circular nib is zero.

<P> Offsetting is a longstanding way of specifying a line of fixed thickness in
terms of a contour—that is, a sequence of connecting splines—combined with an
offset radius. The model was common in PostScript and is currently used in the
SVG graphics markup language.  Most font formats do not support offset curves
directly, however, so any line specified that way must be "translated" into
(roughly) equivalent closed contours. This is a common use of the Expand Stroke
facility.

<P> The parallel lines determined by the contour and offset radius alone will
not necessarily connect. They will all connect in the case of a source contour
that is closed and has only "smooth" points:

<figure><object data="stroke/offset_smooth.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="80%" class="svgfig">Offsets of a smooth contour</object></figure>

<P> They will not connect where the source contour is open or has "corner"
points where the angle changes:

<figure><object data="stroke/offset_other.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="70%" class="svgfig">Offsets of angled and open contour</object></figure>

<H3 id="cap">Caps</H3>

The line that closes the gap between the offset lines traced to the end of of
an open source contour is called a "cap". PostScript and SVG specify three cap
styles that are really two styles: "Round" and "Butt"/"Square".  A Round cap
connects the ends with a semi-circle, while a Butt cap connects them with a
straight line. When tracing with a circular nib the FontForge cap options
"Nib" and "Round" are both equivalent to PS/SVG "Round", and the options "Butt"
and "Bevel" are both equivalent to PS/SVG "Butt". (These options differ when
used with other nib shapes.)

<figure><object data="stroke/caps.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="70%" class="svgfig">Butt and Round Caps</object></figure>

<P> A PS/SVG "Square" cap is a Butt cap extended by the length of the offset
radius, and therefore half the width of the traced line. The FontForge "Extend
Cap" parameter generalizes this feature by allowing the user to specify the
distance between the end of the source contour and the cap line either as an
absolute length or in units of half-stroke-width. The parameter works with the
"Round" and "Butt" cap styles but not the "Nib" and "Bevel" styles. A PS/SVG
Square cap is therefore equivalent to a Butt cap with "Extend Cap" set to 1 in
half-stroke-width units.

<figure><object data="stroke/extend_cap.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="70%" class="svgfig">Extend Cap Examples</object></figure>

<H3 id="join">Joins</H3>

When the source contour has a "corner" point with an angle change there will be
one angle of less than 180 degrees and one greater than 180 degrees. The offset
lines on the side with the smaller angle will intersect, and the easy solution
is to trim off the parts of the line past the intersection:

<figure><object data="stroke/join_trimmed.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="70%" class="svgfig">Offset Trimmed At Join</object></figure>

<P> The offset lines at the larger "reflex" angle do not meet. The line closing
the gap between those is called a "join".  PostScript specified three join
styles: "Round", "Bevel" and "Miter". SVG 2.0 adds styles "Miter Clip" and
"Arcs".  FontForge currently supports the six styles "Nib", "Bevel", "Round",
"Miter", "Miter Clip", and "Arcs".

<P> A PS/SVG "Bevel" join connects the two offset curves with a straight line,
and this is also what FontForge's "Bevel" option does.  A PS/SVG "Miter" or SVG
"Miter Clip" join (normally) extends each offset curve with a straight line
tangent to the curve at the endpoint to where each intersects, as do
FontForge's equivalent "Miter" and "Miter Clip" options. A FontForge "Nib"
join connects the offset curves with an edge corresponding to the shape of the
nib; when using a round nib this is equivalent to the PS/SVG "Round" join
option, which connects the offset lines with an arc of the offset radius. 
FontForge's "Round" join option is also equivalent when using a circular nib:

<figure><object data="stroke/joins.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="100%" class="svgfig">Join Examples</object></figure>

<P> The difference between Miter and Miter Clip is in how "long" joins are
handled. The "Join Limit" parameter specifies the maximum "length" of a miter
join.  This limit can be specified either in em-units or (when the nib is
circular) in offset radii. The term "join length" is a bit misleading because
the limit is actually calculated based on the angle of the join, and the
"length" is how long the join <em>would</em> be if the offset curves were
straight lines.  There is a more complete explanation in the
<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/painting.html#LineJoin"><CODE>stroke-miterlimit"</CODE>
section of the SVG specification</A>.  With the Miter style a join that
exceeds the join limit "falls back" to a Bevel join, while with the Miter Clip
such a join is clipped at the join limit by a line parallel to the Bevel line:

<figure><object data="stroke/miters.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="60%" class="svgfig">Miter and Miter Clip</object></figure>

<P> Note, however, that the term "limit" is also somewhat misleading, in that
a Miter join is <em>never</em> shortened past the Bevel line, which therefore
restricts the minimum length of a given join.

<P> Like Miter Clip, the "Arcs" join style matches the position and tangent
angles at each offset curve endpoint, but the curve is extended with a circular
arc of matching curvature rather than a line. (In some cases the curvature
of the extensions must be adjusted to ensure they intersect, in which case
the curvatures at the endpoints will not be continuous.) This style
is based on the SVG 2 join of the same name and should have close to the
same geometry when used with a circular nib. (Arcs joins are not yet
widely supported in browsers or other SVG tools and there are some 
ambiguities in the specification.) 

<P> Note that Arcs joins exceeding the Join Limit are clipped in a way 
similar to those of the Miter Clip style.

<H2 id="nibs">Calligraphic and Other Convex Nibs</H2>

<P> In addition to circular nibs the Expand Stroke facility also has
parameterized support for "Calligraphic" (rectangular) and Elliptical nibs.
These nibs are described by Width and Height (called the Major and Minor
Axes in the case of an ellipse) and a rotation Angle:

<figure><object data="stroke/paramnibs.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="70%" class="svgfig">Calligraphic and Elliptical Nibs</object></figure>

<H3>General convex nibs</H3>

<P> In contrast with the parameterized nibs, the shape of a Convex nib is
specified as a contour which can be edited interactively in the area at the top
of the dialog, created elsewhere and then pasted into that area, or set via the
Python API. As the name implies the shape enclosed by the contour must be
<em>convex</em>. Formally, a shape is convex when the line between any two
points on the edge of or inside the shape does not pass through any points
<em>not</em> inside the shape (or, if both points are chosen from the same
linear edge, only passes through points also on that edge). Less formally,
a shape is convex when no edges are concave or "indented".

<P> While these definitions may help, it is probably more useful to focus on
the specific rules used by the facility to verify that a contour is convex.
These rules are slightly conservative, in that some geometrically convex
contours fail to meet them. (Such cases are rare in practice, and can anyway
often be "repaired" by adding some points without (visibly) changing the
shape.)

<P> Note: These rules are defined in relation to a cubic contour.  Although you
can design a nib as a quadratic contour, you must switch the layer to "Cubic"
before applying Expand Stroke. (Or, in the API, you must convert the contour or
layer prior to calling the <CODE>stroke</CODE> method or
<CODE>ExpandStroke</CODE> function.) In contrast, when using a Spiro nib on a
Cubic layer it is not necessary to switch into Bezier mode. However, it can
still be a good idea to do so to better understand any reported errors. 

<P> There are actually two groups of rules.  The first group restrict the
relative positions of <em>on-curve</em> points. The points must be arranged as
a <em>convex polygon</em>, which is a non-self-intersecting (i.e.  "simple")
polygon of at least 3 points/edges, where all interior angles at the points are
less than 180 degrees.  These points must be in the form of a closed,
<em>clockwise</em> contour:

<figure><object data="stroke/convexpoly.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="90%" class="svgfig">Convex Polygons and Exceptions</object></figure>

<P> The second group of rules restrict the relative positions of the control
points:

<OL>
  <LI> Each spline must either be a line with <em>no control points</em>,
       or have two control points positioned outside of the convex polygon.
       That means they can not be either inside the polygon or on the edge of
       the polygon.
 <LI> The angle between the on-curve line and the control point line is
      limited by the angle to that point's other control point. Or, if the
      adjacent "edge" is a line, the angle to the next on-curve point.
 <LI> The control point <em>line segment</em> must not intersect the spline's
      other control point <em>line</em>.
</OL>

<P> These three rules typically define a triangle (with one excluded edge) where
one control point can be positioned given the positions of the other points:

<figure><object data="stroke/convexcontrol.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="90%" class="svgfig">Control Point Rules for Convex Shapes</object></figure>

<P> Aside from the shape, the position of a convex nib relative to the 
origin has an effect on the output. Parameterized nibs are always centered
on the origin, which leaves the output in the "same place" as the source
contour. A nib offset from the origin will cause the output to be offset
by that amount:

<figure><object data="stroke/uncentered.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="90%" class="svgfig">Centered and Uncentered Convex Nib Output</object></figure>

<H3>Caps and Joins With Other Nibs</H3>

<P> Earlier versions of FontForge only provided cap and join options for
circular and elliptical nibs (and some of the latter were misleadingly named).
For other nibs it automatically closed the cap and join edges with the nib
shape—equivalent to the current "Nib" cap and join styles.  Given that the Nib
options produce the shape that would be created by inking and tracing the nib
on paper, "Nib" is a good default choice:

<figure><object data="stroke/nibnib.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="50%" class="svgfig">Calligraphic nib with Nib Cap and Join</object></figure>

<P> The other cap and join options now also work with all nibs. Although some
"behave" differently with different nib geometries, in general you can choose a
style based on how it looks when used with a circular nib.  The rest of this
section describes some differences from the "circular case". 

<P> When tracing with a circular nib, the angles ends of the offset curves at a
join are always perpendicular to the line from source contour point. This is
not true for other nibs. The difference lead to unexpected results with Bevel
and clipped Miter Clip joins, although both are constructed according to the
same rules.

<figure><object data="stroke/customjoinbevel.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="60%" class="svgfig">Join Bevel Angle of Custom Nib</object></figure>

<P> For similar reasons it is often impossible to close an arbitrary join 
with a smooth circular arc. When the Round join is specified in such cases 
FontForge will instead choose the smooth arc of the least eccentric 
compatible ellipse (which might still be noticeably eccentric).

<figure><object data="stroke/customround.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="60%" class="svgfig">Round Join of Custom Nib</object></figure>

<P> No matter what nib you use, at the end of any open contour the tangent
angle of the left and right lines will be the same as the tangent angle of
the end of the source contour. However, the <em>length</em> of these lines
will vary. With a circular nib a Bevel Cap is the same as a Butt Cap; with
other nibs the Bevel angle differs and the Bevel will often not touch the
end of the traced contour. (The Bevel cap option just draws a line between the
ends of the two trace lines.  This option is an unusual choice for a final cap
style, but may be useful to see where the trace lines end in a given case or 
as the simplest option for later editing stages.)

<figure><object data="stroke/customcapbevel.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="90%" class="svgfig">Cap Angle of Custom Nib</object></figure>

<P> FontForge will not trim a trace line to make a Butt or Round cap; instead
it extends one of the lines to match the other. This means that Butt and Round
caps often extend past the end of the source contour, with a distance that
depends on the nib shape and the cap angle. If this is a problem the Extend Cap
option provides one easy solution: The extension length is always measured from
the end of the source contour, so higher values will tend to even out the
lengths. At some value—the particular amount depends on the nib and the source
contours—all cap distances will be the same.

<figure><object data="stroke/extendcapfix.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="90%" class="svgfig">Standardizing Cap Length with Extend Cap</object></figure>

<P> With a circular nib the em-unit and half-span ways of specifying a Join
Limit or Extend Cap length are basically equivalent: for every value expressed
one way there is a value expressed the other way that has the same effect.
With other nibs the width of the curve varies by angle, breaking this
equivalence.  In the case of Extend Cap, the cap width is defined as the span
of the nib at the end angle—that is, the width of the nib when it is rotated by
that angle.  For Join Limit the "Nib Span" is defined—somewhat artificially—as
the average of the nib spans at the starting and ending angles of the join.
The result is that when using Width/Span-relative values the result will tend
to scale with the stroke width at the join or cap.

<figure><object data="stroke/extendcapdiff.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="90%" class="svgfig">Relative and Length-based Extend Cap with Custom Nibs</object></figure>

<P> Unclipped, the Arcs join style should work the same way for other nibs
as it does with circular nibs. However, with shorter Join Limits (less than
4 in relative units) and more oblong nibs the SVG 2 clipping algorithm may
fail. The <A HREF="#arcsclip">Arcs Clip Parameter</A> section has more 
information.

<H3>Multi-Nibs and "Pseudo-Concavity"</H3>

<P> Although a nib will typically consist of a single convex contour,
the nib <CODE>foreground</CODE> layer can contain multiple contours
as long as each conforms to the shape rules. Each source contour will
be traced with each nib contour and then combined. 

<P> Because the nib contours can overlap, you can simulate a concave
nib by splitting the shape into convex sub-shapes and putting each in
its own contour. When doing this it is best if the contours actually
overlap where they meet rather than just "touch". 

<H2 id="parameters">Other Parameters</H2>

<P> The remaining Expand Stroke parameters have default values that work well
for most cases, but you may need or want to change them in more unusual
cases or when you encounter problems.

<H3>Accuracy Target</H3>

<P> The "Accuracy Target" is specified in em-units and influences the geometric
accuracy of the output.  The algorithms generally "try" to be at least as
accurate as the target but there can be exceptions. The default of 0.25 is a
reasonable choice even you plan to round-to-integer later, although a value of
1 or even higher may well depending on your needs. Given that the Expand
Stroke algorithms are generally fast, the benefit of lower accuracy is not
speed but fewer points/splines in the output.

<figure><object data="stroke/accuracytarget.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="70%" class="svgfig">Outputs with Different Accuracy Targets</object></figure>

<H3>Remove Overlap</H3>

<P> The core algorithm of Expand Stroke calculates the "generalized offset
curves" of the source contour and the nib. Its output can therefore include
"cusps" and other artifacts of offsetting. These are typically removed by
passing the initial output through the Remove Overlap algorithm. By default
Remove Overlap is run on the whole layer, but you can also choose to run it
independently on the output of each source contour.

<P> The third option is to skip the Remove Overlap pass entirely. This option
is provided mostly for debugging purposes. In rare cases the Remove Overlap
algorithm may fail or produce inaccurate results. If you run into problems
it can therefore be helpful to "undo" and run Expand Stroke again without
Remove Overlap to see what the problem might be. (And you may be able to fix
the problem area by hand and then run Remove Overlap on the rest, and get your
output without having to wait for a software fix.)

<figure><object data="stroke/removeoverlap.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="80%" class="svgfig">Outputs with Different Remove Overlap Settings</object></figure>

<H3>External Only and Internal Only</H3>

<P> As noted above a closed source contour will typically yield a larger
contour enclosing a smaller one. The External Only and Internal Only
options allow the user to choose one of the two contours produced in this way.
However, the options names are somewhat misleading. They are accurate in the
case of a <em>clockwise source</em> contour: when External Only is chosen
only the larger, outer, clockwise contour is returned while when Internal Only
is chosen only the smaller, inner, counterclockwise contour is returned. When
tracing a <em>counterclockwise source</em> contour, however, the two options 
have the opposite effect.

<P> As a result, when offsetting a typical "o" (for example), choosing External
Only will keep the larger clockwise counterpart of the glyph's larger
clockwise contour and the smaller counterclockwise counterpart of the glyph's
smaller counterclockwise contour. This increases the "weight" of the character
by <em>2r</em>—the diameter of the nib. Choosing Internal Only analogously
decreases the weight by <em>2r</em>, assuming it is thicker than that at all
points. (FontForge's Change Weight facility uses Expand Stroke with these
options.)

<figure><object data="stroke/intext.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="80%" class="svgfig">Example of External Only and External Only</object></figure>

<H3>Add Extrema and Simplify</H3>

<P> It is normally desirable to avoid mid-spline extrema and to remove unneeded
on-curve points and (in the case of straight lines) unneeded control points.
Therefore Expand Stroke normally runs FontForge's Add Extrema and Simplify
algorithms on its output (in that order). You can change this behavior by
changing these options. One reason to do this is if you prefer a different
choice of Simplify parameters. Expand Stroke uses the Accuracy Target as the
Simplify error parameter, but the other parameters are hard-coded and may
change over time.

<H3 id="arcsclip">Arcs Clip Algorithm</H3>

<P> The SVG 2 specification clips an Arcs join perpendicular to a circle
through the source contour knot (where the angle changes, requiring the join)
and the intersection of the arcs. This approach works well for roughly-round
nibs at any Join Limit and for any nibs at longer Join Limits. Unfortunately
it can produce poor or nonsensical results for oblong nibs at shorter Join
Limits. To handle such cases FontForge includes an alternate "Ratio" Arcs
join clipping algorithm. 

<P> The default "Auto" setting uses the SVG 2 algorithm unless the ratio of
maximum to minimum axis for a circular or calligraphic nib is greater than 
2 and the Join Limit is relative to Nib Span and less than 4, in which case
it uses the Ratio algorithm. (With a custom convex nib it uses Ratio when
the Join Limit is relative and less than 4 regardless of nib dimension.) 
This heuristic works in many cases but is not foolproof.
