  <DL>
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Undo">Undo</A>
    <DD>
      In the outline view and the bitmap view this will undo the last command.
      The number of commands that may be undone for any glyph is controlled by
      the <A HREF="prefs.html#UndoDepth">UndoDepth</A> preference item.<BR>
      In the font and metrics views, this does NOT undo the last command. It undoes
      the last operation on all selected glyphs.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Redo">Redo</A>
    <DD>
      In the outline view and the bitmap view this will redo the last command undone.
      Up to twelve commands may be redone (after that they get thrown away)<BR>
      In the font and metrics views, this does NOT undo the last command. It undoes
      the last operation on all selected glyphs.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Cut">Cut</A>
    <DD>
      In the font view this command puts the foreground of all selected glyphs
      into the clipboard and then deletes them. Depending on the setting of
      <A HREF="#From">Copy From</A> it will either refer all glyphs (bitmap and
      outline) corresponding to this entry, or just the glyph being displayed.
      <P>
      In the Outline View this will copy any selected points, References, or Images
      into the clipboard and then delete them. If a point is removed from a path
      then the path will be broken at there, see the <A HREF="#Merge">Merge</A>
      command for information on how to leave the path whole but without the point.
      (if there is no selection nothing happens)
      <P>
      In the Bitmap View this will copy the selection into the clipboard and then
      delete it. If there is no selection nothing happens.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Copy">Copy</A>
    <DD>
      In the font view this command puts the foreground and hints of all selected
      glyphs into the clipboard. Depending on the setting of <A HREF="#From">Copy
      From</A> it will either copy all glyphs (bitmap and outline) corresponding
      to this entry, or just the glyph being displayed. Normally it will not copy
      a glyph's name, but if <A HREF="#CharName">Copy From-&gt;Char Name</A> is
      set then it will copy the name as well.
      <P>
      In the Outline View this will copy any selected points, References, or Images
      into the clipboard. If there is no selection everything in the current layer
      will go into the clipboard.
      <P>
      In the Bitmap View this will copy the selection into the clipboard, if there
      is no selection everything is copied.
      <P>
      To external applications selected points (and associated contours) will be
      exported to the clipboard with format "image/eps", while a selected image
      will be exported with formats "image/png" and "image/bmp". If you Copy a
      series of glyphs into the clipboard, the only the first one will be exported
      to external applications. If the clipboard contains a single point, then
      this will also be exported in STRING format (giving the coordinates of the
      point); the intent is to make it easier to people to identify the point.
      See the section on <A HREF="selections.html">selections</A>
    <DT>
      Copy <A NAME="Reference">Reference</A>
    <DD>
      In the font view this command puts a reference to all selected glyphs into
      the clipboard.
      <P>
      In the Outline View this will copy a reference to the current glyph into
      the clipboard (only available in foreground mode).
      <P>
      This command is not available in the Bitmap View.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="CopyLookup">Copy Lookup Data</A>
    <DD>
      Copies lookup data (substitutions, ligatures, kerning, anchor points, etc)
      from the selected glyphs. This command does not work quite as expected:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The data are not actually copied. Instead fontforge makes a note of which
	  glyphs it copied the data from. FontForge actually copies the data when the
	  user does a Paste (so any changes in the lookup data will be pasted).
	<LI>
	  When the user does a Paste s/he will be prompted with a dialog asking what
	  lookups should be copied.
      </UL>
    <DT>
      Copy <A NAME="Width">Width</A>
    <DD>
      In the Font View this command copies the widths of all selected glyphs and
      stores them in the clipboard.
      <P>
      In the Outline View this command copies the width of the current glyph and
      stores it in the clipboard.
      <P>
      This command is not available in the Bitmap View.
    <DT>
      Copy <A NAME="VWidth">VWidth</A>
    <DD>
      In the Font View this command copies the vertical widths of all selected
      glyphs and stores them in the clipboard.
      <P>
      In the Outline View this command copies the vertical width of the current
      glyph and stores it in the clipboard.
      <P>
      This command is not available in the Bitmap View.
    <DT>
      Copy <A NAME="LBearing">LBearing</A>
    <DD>
      In the Font View this command copies the left side bearings of all selected
      glyphs and stores them in the clipboard.
      <P>
      In the Outline View this command copies the left side bearing of the current
      glyph and stores it in the clipboard.
      <P>
      This command is not available in the Bitmap View.
    <DT>
      Copy <A NAME="RBearing">RBearing</A>
    <DD>
      In the Font View this command copies the right side bearings of all selected
      glyphs and stores them in the clipboard.
      <P>
      In the Outline View this command copies the right side bearing of the current
      glyph and stores it in the clipboard.
      <P>
      This command is not available in the Bitmap View.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="CopyGridFit">Copy Grid Fit</A>
    <DD>
      Only available in the outline glyph view and only if
      <A HREF="viewmenu.html#ShowGridFit">View-&gt;Show Grid Fit </A>is selected.
      This will place a copy of the grid fit version of the glyph into the clipboard.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Paste">Paste</A>
    <DD>
      In the Font View this command will paste whatever is in the clipboard into
      the foregrounds of all selected glyphs (exception: if the clipboard contains
      an image it will usually not go into the foreground), clearing out whatever
      was there. If there are more selected glyphs than there is information in
      the clipboard then the clipboard will be repeated until all selected glyphs
      have had something pasted in them (that is if glyphs A and B were selected
      when the copy happened and now glyphs C, D and E are selected, the C will
      get A, D will get B and E will also get A). If exactly one glyph is selected
      but the clipboard contains more that one glyph, the the selection will be
      extended so that enough glyphs are selected that something may be pasted
      in each. <BR>
      If the clipboard contains outline information then that information will
      go into the glyph outline regardless of the setting of Copy From. If the
      clipboard contains a bitmap and the display is set to outline then the bitmap
      is pasted into the bitmap font it was copied from (ie. the one with the same
      pixel size), if the clipboard contains a bitmap and the display is set to
      a bitmap then the bitmap will be pasted into the currently displayed font.
      If the clipboard contains a bitmap of a size which does not exist in our
      database, then you will be asked if you want to create a bitmap font to put
      the bitmap into.
      <P>
      In the Outline View this command will paste whatever is in the clipboard
      to the current editing layer.
      <P>
      In the Bitmap View this command will flatten any floating selection and paste
      the contents of the clipboard into a new floating selection.
      <P>
      If the clipboard is owned by an external application FontForge will attempt
      to Paste the following selection types (the bitmap view does not currently
      respond to external clipboards):
      <TABLE BORDER>
	<TR>
	  <TD>"image/png", "image/bmp"</TD>
	  <TD>background images</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
	  <TD>"image/eps", "image/ps", "image/svg"</TD>
	  <TD>as spline data</TD>
	</TR>
      </TABLE>
      <P>
      See the section on <A HREF="selections.html">selections</A>
    <DT>
      <A NAME="PasteInto">Paste Into</A>
    <DD>
      Only available in the fontview. Just like Paste, except it does not clear
      the contents of the glyph before adding to it.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="PasteAfter">Paste After</A>
    <DD>
      Only available in the fontview. Pastes the contents of the clipboard into
      the selected glyph, shifts it over by the advance width, and then adds the
      advance width of the glyph in the clip to this glyph. Essentially this makes
      it easy to build up words. (If the font has vertical metrics, then glyphs
      will be stacked vertically. If the glyph is right to left then the clipboard
      will be added on the left).
      <P>
      This command is not present unless you modify configure-pfaedit.h
    <DT>
      <A NAME="SameGlyphAs">Same Glyph As</A>
    <DD>
      Only available in the fontview. If the clipboard contains a single reference
      to a glyph then applying this command makes all selected encoding points
      refer to that same glyph. (For example the non-breaking-space glyph (U+00A0)
      frequently uses the same glyph as the space glyph. To accomplish this, select
      the space glyph, Copy Ref, select the non-breaking-space glyph and Same Glyph
      As).
      <P>
      Adobe suggests that you avoid this. Use a reference instead. In some situations
      (I think pdf files is one) having one glyph with several encodings causes
      problems (Acrobat uses the glyph to back-map through the encoding to work
      out the unicode code point. But that will fail if a glyph has two unicode
      code points associated with it).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Clear">Clear</A>
    <DD>
      Similar to <A HREF="#Cut">Cut</A> except it does not copy anything to the
      clipboard.
    <DT>
      Clear <A NAME="Background">Background</A>
    <DD>
      Only in the font view. This command clears the backgrounds of all selected
      glyphs.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Merge">Merge</A>
    <DD>
      This command is only available in the Outline View. If a point on a path
      is selected, the the merge command will remove that point from the path and
      join the two points around the removed one with a new spline which approximates
      the curve between the two before. The two surrounding points will retain
      their slopes (unless both are corner points).
      <P>
      <A HREF="pfaeditmath.html#Approximating">How is this done?</A>
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Join">Join</A>
    <DD>
      This command is not available in the bitmap view. It looks for any paths
      with endpoints as the endpoints of other paths and then join those two paths.
      Also if the endpoint of a path is the same as the start point it will make
      that path into a loop. (The commands that move points around will normally
      do this automatically, but Paste will not).<BR>
      In the Outline view things are slightly more complicated: If any paths have
      selected points on them it will only attempt to join those paths.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="CopyFg">Copy Fg To Bg</A>
    <DD>
      This command is only available in the Outline and Font Views. It cleans out
      all the splines in the background layer and replaces them with a copy of
      all the splines in the foreground layer. Note: Any background images remain.
      No references are copied.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Select">Select</A>
    <DD>
      In the outline view there is a select menu, other views just have Select
      All.
      <DL>
	<DT>
	  Select <A NAME="All">All</A>
	<DD>
	  In the outline view it selects all points, all references (all images if
	  the background is active) and the width line (and the vertical width line
	  if that is enabled). In the fontview it selects all glyphs. In the bitmap
	  view it selects the current bitmap region.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="Invert">Invert</A> Selection
	<DD>
	  Selects anything not selected, and deselects everything selected.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="Deselect">Deselect</A> All
	<DD>
	  Deselects anything selected
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="FirstPt">First Point</A>
	<DD>
	  Deselects everything and then selects the first point on the first path of
	  the glyph.
	<DT>
	  First Point, <A NAME="NextContour">Next Contour</A>
	<DD>
	  Deselects everything and then selects the first point on the next contour.
	  (If the last contour is selected then deselects everything).
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="NextP">Next</A> Point
	<DD>
	  Deselects the current point and selects the next point.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="PrevP">Prev</A> Point
	<DD>
	  Deselects the current point and selects the previous point
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="NextCP">Next</A> Control Point
	<DD>
	  Selects the "Next Control Point" of the current point.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="PrevCP">Prev</A> Control Point
	<DD>
	  Selects the "Prev Control Point" of the current point.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="PointAt">Point At</A>
	<DD>
	  Allows the user to enter an X,Y coordinate and selects the point at that
	  location.
	<DT>
	  Points on Selected <A NAME="Contours">Contours</A>
	<DD>
	  If a contour contains any selected points, then select all points on the
	  contour.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="SelectPoints">Select</A> All Points &amp; Refs
	<DD>
	  Just like select all, but it doesn't select anchor points or the width lines.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="SelectAnchors">Select</A> Anchors
	<DD>
	  Select all the Anchor points in the glyph.
	<DT>
	  (De)<A NAME="SelWidth">Select</A> Width
	<DD>
	  Toggles whether the width line is selected.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="SelVWidth">(De)Select</A> VWidth
	<DD>
	  (if vertical metrics are enabled) Toggles whether the vertical width line
	  is selected.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="SelHM">Select Points Affected by Current HintMask</A>
	<DD>
	  if a single point with a hintmask is selected, then this command selects
	  all points affected by that hintmask.
	<DT>
	  Select <A NAME="Color">Color</A>&gt;
	<DD>
	  Only in the font view. Displays a submenu containing a list of colors and
	  allows you to select all glyphs which you have set to that color with the
	  Char Info dlg. Normally the selection is cleared before setting the colored
	  glyphs, but if you hold down the shift key the selection will be extended
	  to the colored glyphs.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="SelectName">Select By Wildcard...</A>
	<DD>
	  Select all glyphs that match the wildcard pattern specified. A glyph may
	  also be mapped to more than one encoding slot. Select all encoding slots
	  that refer to the named glyph. I think this is primarily useful for detaching
	  .notdef.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="SelectScript">Select By Script...</A>
	<DD>
	  Allows you to specify an OpenType script tag and then ff will select all
	  glyphs which have that script.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="SelChanged">Changed</A>
	<DD>
	  Selects all changed glyphs
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="SelHinting">Hinting Needed</A>
	<DD>
	  Selects all glyphs which FontForge thinks need to be hinted.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="SelAutohintable">Autohintable</A>
	<DD>
	  Selects all glyphs which FontForge thinks can be autohinted -- ie. all glyphs
	  not marked <A HREF="hintsmenu.html#DontAutoHint">Hints-&gt;Don't Autohint</A>
	  (this does not check whether ff thinks the glyphs in question NEED to be
	  autohinted)
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="SelectByATT">Select By Lookup Subtable...</A>
	<DD>
	  Only in the font view. Brings up a <A HREF="selectbyatt.html">dlg</A> which
	  allows you to select various glyphs depending on various advanced typographic
	  features.
      </DL>
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Find">Find</A> / Replace
    <DD>
      Only in the font view, this brings up a <A HREF="search.html">dialog</A>
      that allows you to find patterns within glyphs and replace them with other
      patterns.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="ReplaceRef">Replace </A>With Reference
    <DD>
      Only in the font view, this command will search the font finding any glyph
      which contains an inline copy of one of the selected glyphs, and converts
      that copy into a reference to the appropriate glyph. In other words it finds
      things which should be references and makes them be.
      <P>
      This is primarily for use after reading a postscript (type1, otf or cff)
      font. The reference information will usually be lost in these formats, and
      this command can find it again.
      <P>
      Suppose the font contains a glyph "Acircumflex" which contains an embedded
      copy of "A" (a copy of the contours, not a references), then if you select
      "A" and apply this command it will search all glyphs in the font for something
      that looks like "A", remove it from any glyphs in which it is found and replace
      it with a reference. It applies this same algorithm for all selected glyphs.
      If you want to check for every possibility, just select all glyphs first.
      <P>
      After completion, the selection will be set to those glyphs which have been
      changed by the command.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Unlink">Unlink</A> Reference
    <DD>
      This will remove a referenced glyph and replace it with the splines and points
      that make it up.
    <DT>
      Copy <A NAME="From">From</A>
    <DD>
      Only available in the Font View.
      <DL>
	<DT>
	  All <A NAME="Fonts">Fonts</A>
	<DD>
	  If this is set then Copy (and Cut and Clear) will copy from the outline font
	  and from all the bitmap fonts
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="Displayed">Displayed</A> Font
	<DD>
	  If this is set then Copy will only copy from the font currently being displayed.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="CharName">Char Metadata</A>
	<DD>
	  Normally Copy does not copy the metadata (name, unicode encoding, comment,
	  ligature info) associated with a glyph, but if this is checked then it will.
	<DT>
	  <A NAME="TTInstr">TrueType Instructions</A>
	<DD>
	  Controls whether truetype instructions should be copied with a glyph. If
	  copying glyphs from one font to another it may not be appropriate to copy
	  the truetype instructions (which may depend on subroutines or values in the
	  'fpgm', 'prep' and 'cvt ' tables).
      </DL>
      <P>
      This also controls the behavior of the
      <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Transform">Transform</A> and
      <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Accented">Build Accented</A> glyph commands.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Remove-Undoes">Remove Undoes</A>
    <DD>
      Not available in the Metrics View. This allows you to free up some of the
      memory FontForge is currently squandering on keeping track of Undoes (and
      Redoes). Obviously this command cannot be undone.
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  In the Outline Glyph view this will free up all undoes/redoes in the current
	  edit mode
	<LI>
	  In the Bitmap Glyph view this will free up all bitmap undoes/redoes
	<LI>
	  In the Font View this will free up all undoes/redoes in all selected glyphs,
	  outline and bitmap, background and foreground.
      </UL>
