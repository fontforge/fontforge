    Writing python scripts to change fonts in FontForge
  </H1>
  <P>
  I assume you have a working knowledge of python (because I do not).
  <A href="http://www.python.org/doc/">Python documentation may be found on
  the web.</A> FontForge implements two python modules -- one great huge one
  called <CODE><A HREF="python.html#fontforge">fontforge</A></CODE> which provides
  access to as much of FontForge's functionality as I've had time to write,
  and one tiny one called
  <CODE><A HREF="python.html#psMat">psMat</A></CODE> which provides quick access
  to some useful transformations expressed as PostScript matrices.
  <P>
  In python terms fontforge <EM>embeds</EM> python. It is possible to build
  fontforge so that it is also a <A HREF="#Extension">python <EM>extension</EM>
  </A>(<CODE>configure --enable-pyextension</CODE>)
  <P>
  The fontforge module also defines several types

      <TD>The GlpyphSeparationHook is a python routine which FontForge will call
	when it wants to figure out the optical separation between two glyphs. If
	you neve call this, or if you call it with a value of <CODE>None</CODE> FontForge
	will use a built-in default. This routine gets called during AutoWidth, AutoKern,
	and computing the optical left and right side bearings (for 'lfbd' and 'rtbd'
	features). For more infomation see
	<A HREF="autowidth.html#GlyphSeparationHook">its own section</A>.</TD>

      <TH colspan=3>User Interface Methods</TH>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD colspan=3><A NAME="python-init-scripts">Users</A> may define scripts
	to be run when menu items are invoked. Some of these scripts will want to
	ask users questions, so this section provides routines to determine if fontforge
	has a user interface, a command to add menu items, and various small standard
	dialogs to interact with the user. I do not currently provide a mechanism
	for allowing people to define special purpose dialogs (for example they might
	want to ask more than one question in a dialog, and I don't support that).
	<P>
	When FontForge <A NAME="starts">starts</A> (if it's a fontforge with python)
	it will look at the directories <CODE>$(PREFIX)/share/fontforge/python</CODE>
	and <CODE>~/.FontForge/python</CODE> and attempt to run all files in those
	directories which end in ".py". Presumably these files will allow people
	to customize the user interface to suit their needs.
	<P>
	Currently it reads the files in directory order (which is generally somewhere
	between creation order and totally random). It will read the system directory
	before the user directory.
	<H3>
	  Example
	</H3>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	  <PRE>import fontforge;

def nameGlyph(junk,glyph):
  print glyph.glyphname;

fontforge.registerMenuItem(nameGlyph,None,None,"Glyph",None,"Print Glyph Name");

def neverEnableMe(junk,glyph):
  return False;

fontforge.registerMenuItem(nameGlyph,neverEnableMe,None,"Glyph",None,"SubMenu","Print Glyph Name");

def importGlyph(junk,glyph,filename,toback):
  print "Import";
  print glyph.glyphname;
  print filename;
def exportGlyph(junk,glyph,filename):
  print "Import";
  print glyph.glyphname;
  print filename;

fontforge.registerImportExport(importGlyph,exportGlyph,None,"foosball","foo","foo,foobar")
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
	The first call will define a menu item in the Tools menu of the Glyph window.
	The menu will be called "Print Glyph Name". It has no shortcut to invoke
	it. It needs no external data. It is always enabled. And when activated it
	will invoke the function "nameGlyph" whch prints the name of the glyph in
	the window from which the command is invoked.
	<P>
	The second call defines a menu item in a submenu of the Tools menu. This
	submenu is called "SubMenu". This item will never be enabled -- but if it
	were enabled it would again call "nameGlyph" to print the name of the current
	glyph.
	<P>
	The last provides a way to import and export files of type "foosball" (or
	it would if the routines did anything).

      <TD>If fontforge has a user interface this will add this menu item to FontForge's

	glyph view (or both).
	<DL>
	  <DT>
	    menu-function
	  <DD>
	    This is the function that will be called when the menu item is activated.
	    It will be passed two arguments, the first is the data value specified here
	    (which may be None, indeed will probably usually be None), and the second
	    is the glyph or font (depending on the window type) from which the menu item
	    was activated. Its return value is ignored.
	  <DT>
	    enable_function
	  <DD>
	    This may be None -- in which case the menu item will always be enabled. Otherwise
	    it will be called before the menu pops up on the screen to determine whether
	    this item should be enabled. It will be passed the same arguments as above.
	    It should return True if the item should be enabled and False otherwise.
	  <DT>
	    data
	  <DD>
	    This can be whatever you want (including None). FontForge keeps track of
	    it and passes it to both of the above functions. Use it if you need to provide
	    some context for the menu item.
	  <DT>
	    which_window
	  <DD>
	    May be either of the strings "Font" or "Glyph (or the tuple
	    <CODE>("Font","Glyph")</CODE>) and it determines which type of window will
	    have this menu item in its "Tools" menu.
	  <DT>
	    shortcut-string
	  <DD>
	    May be None if you do not wish to supply a shortcut. Otherwise should be
	    a string like "Menu Name|Cntl-H" (the syntax is defined in the
	    <A HREF="uitranslationnotes.html#HotKeys">translation section</A>).
	  <DT>
	    submenu-names
	  <DD>
	    You may specify as many of these as you wish (including leaving them out
	    altogether), this allows you to organize the Tools menu into submenus. (If
	    a submenu of this name does not currently exist, fontforge will create it).
	  <DT>
	    menu-name
	  <DD>
	    The name that will appear in the menu for this item.
	</DL>
	<P>
	This will only affect windows created after this command is executed. Normally
	the command will be executed at startup and so it will affect all windows.</TD>

	    The function to call to import a file into a glyph. It will be called with:

	    extension

	    extension-list
	  <DD>
	    Some file types have more than one common extension (eps files are usually
	    named "eps", but I have also seen "ps" and "art" used). The import dialog
	    needs to filter all possible filenames of this file type. This argument should
	    be a comma separated list of extensions. It may be omitted, in which case
	    it defaults to being the same as the "extension" argument above.

      <TH colspan=3>Description</TH>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD colspan=3>A contour is a collection of points. A contour may be either
	based on cubic or quadratic splines.
	<P>
	If based on cubic splines there should be either 0 or 2 off-curve points
	between every two on-curve points. If there are no off-curve points then
	we have a line between those two points. If there are 2 off-curve points
	we have a cubic bezier curve between the two end points.
	<P>
	If based on quadratic splines things are more complex. Again, two adjacent
	on-curve points yield a line between those points. Two on-curve points with
	an off-curve point between them yields a quadratic bezier curve. However
	if there are two adjacent off-curve points then an on-curve point will be
	interpolated between them. (This should be familiar to anyone who has read
	the truetype 'glyf' table docs).
	<P>
	For examples of what these splines can look like see the
	<A HREF="bezier.html">section on bezier curves</A>.
	<P>
	A contour may be open in which case it is just a long wiggly line, or closed
	when it is more like a circle with an inside and an outside. Unless you are
	making stroked fonts all your contours should eventually be closed.
	<P>
	Contours may also be expressed in terms of Raph Levien's spiro points. This
	is an alternate representation for the contour, and is not always available
	(Only if <CODE><A HREF="python.html#ff-hasSpiro">fontforge.hasSpiro</A>()
	</CODE>is<CODE> True</CODE>. If available the spiro member will return a
	tuple of spiro control points, while assigning to this member will change
	the shape of the contour to match the new spiros.
	<P>
	Two contours may be compared to see if they describe similar paths.</TD>

      <TD>Adds position/substitution data to the glyph. The number and type of
	the arguments vary acording to the type of the lookup containing the subtable.
	The first argument should always be a lookup subtable name. If the lookup
	is for single substitutions then the second argument should be a string
	containing a single glyph name. For multiple and alternated substitutions
	a tuple of glyph names. For ligatures, a tuple of the ligature components
	(glyph names). For single positionings the second through fifth arguments
	should be small integers representing the adjustment along the appropriate
	axis. For pairwise positionings (kerning) the second argument should be the
	name of the other glyph being kerned with, and the third through tenth should
	be small integers -- or, if there are exactly three arguments then the third
	specifies traditional, one-axis, kerning

      <TD>Creates a new subtable and a new kerning class in the named lookup. The

	glyph names is a kerning class). The offsets argument is a tuple of kerning
	offsets. There must be as many entries as
	<CODE>len(first-class)*len(second-class)</CODE>. The optional after argument
	is used to specify the order of the subtable within the lookup.
	<P>
	The second format will cause FontForge to auto kern the subtable. The separation
	argument specifies the desired optical distance between any two glyphs (if
	this is specified as 0 then the kerning class will be designed so glyphs
	just touch each other). Again the user specifies two sets of predefined classes.
	If the (optional) <CODE>onlyCloser</CODE> flag is set true then only negative
	kerning values will be inserted into the table.
	<P>
	In the third format the user merely specifies two lists of glyphs to be used,
	fontforge will look for similarities among among the glyphs and guess at
	classes. The class-distance argument to determine how precise the classes
	should match (1 is very tight matching, 20 is rather loose).
	<P>
	In the last format the font's selection will be used to specify the list
	of glyphs to be examined (and the same list will be used for both the left
	and right glyphs -- but fontforge will probably find different classes).</TD>

      <TD>Creates a new subtable within the specified contextual lookup
        (contextual, contextual chaining, or reverse contextual chaining).
	The lookup name should be a string specifying an existing lookup.
	The subtable name should also be a string and should not match
	any currently existing subtable in the lookup.
	<P>The <CODE>type</CODE> should be one of the strings "glyph", "class",
	"coverage" or "reversecoverage".
	The <CODE>rule</CODE> should be a string specifying a string to match
	and a set of lookups to apply once the match has been made. (See below
	for more details).
	<P>The remaining arguments are optional, keyword arguments.
	<UL><LI><CODE>afterSubtable=</CODE>, if present this should be followed by
	a string, the name of a subtable after which this one is to be placed
	in the lookup. If not specified this subtable will be first in the
	lookup.
	<LI><CODE>bclasses=, fclasses=, mclasses=</CODE> these three arguments
	specify sets of glyph classes for when <CODE>type="class"</CODE>. They
	should be a tuple of thingies where each thingy is either a string
	containing a list of space separated glyph names, or another tuple
	containing a set of strings, each a glyph name. Note that the first
	class is magic and should usually be left as a null string.
	<LI><CODE>bclassnames=, fclassnames=, mclassnames=</CODE> These provide
	names for the glyph classes described above. These names are optional,
	but can be convenient. These are tuples of strings. There should be the
	same number of entries in <CODE>bclassnames</CODE> as there are in
	<CODE>bclasses</code>.
	</UL>
	<DL>
	<DT>
	When <CODE>type="glyph"</CODE>
	<DD>The rule should look something like:<BR/>
	<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;glyph-name1 glyph-name2 | glyph-name3 @&lt;lookup-name&gt; | glyph-name4</CODE><BR/>
	The "|"s divide between backtrack, match and lookahead sections. So this
	example would match it the current glyph were named <CODE>glyph-name3</CODE>
	and it were preceded by <CODE>glyph-name2</CODE> and that by
	<CODE>glyph-name1</CODE> and followed by <CODE>glyph-name4</CODE>. If
	the match were successful then the lookup named <CODE>lookup-name</CODE>
	would be applied. The @&lt;&gt; are litteral characters and should be
	present in the rule.
	<P>If the invoked lookup is a ligature lookup then it should be invoked
	after the first glyph that forms the lookup (rather than the last) and
	all glyphs that might make up the lookup should be in the match section.
	So...<BR/>
	<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;e | f @<ff-lig> f l | o</CODE><BR/>
	would only apply the <CODE>ff-lig</CODE> lookup if the <CODE>ffl</CODE>
	were preceeded by <CODE>e</CODE> and followed by <CODE>o</CODE>.
	<DT>
	When <CODE>type="class"</CODE>
	<DD>The rule should look something like:<BR/>
	<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;class-name1 class-name2 | class-name3 @&lt;lookup-name&gt; | class-name4</CODE><BR/>
	Very similar to the case of glyphs, except that instead of glyph names
	we have class names here. It is possible to have different sets of
	class names in the three different sections (backtrack, match and
	lookahead). If you don't specify any class names then you must use
	numbers instead, each number refering to the class at that position in
	the tuple (the first class will be class 0, the second class 1, and so
	on).
	<DT>
	When <CODE>type="coverage"</CODE>
	<DD>The rule should look something like:<BR/>
	<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;[g1 g2] [g3 g4] | [g5 g6 g7] @&lt;lookup-name&gt; | [g8 g9]</CODE><BR/>
	Each entry within brackets, <CODE>[]</CODE>, represents a coverage table
	and should be a list of glyph names. The brackets are specified literally.
	<DT>
	When <CODE>type="reversecoverage"</CODE>
	<DD>The rule should look something like:<BR/>
	<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;[g1 g2] [g3 g4] | [g5 g6 g7] =&gt; [rg1 rg2 rg3] | [g8 g9]</CODE><BR/>
	Very similar to normal coverage tables except that instead of specifying
	a lookup there are replacement glyphs inline. There must be the same
	number of replacement glyphs (<CODE>rg1, rg2, rg3</CODE>) as match
	glyphs (<CODE>g5, g6, g7</CODE>) and there may be only one coverage
	table in the match section.
	</DL>
	<STRONG>WARNING</STRONG> This format has some limitations, if there are
	multiple lookups they will be applied in textual order (First lookup
	in the string is the first one applied). This limitation is also
	present in Adobe's feature files so I hope it shan't be a severe
	limitation.

      <TD>This function uses keyword parameters. None is required, if omitted a

	<P>
	For each selected letter, this function will create a corresponding small
	caps glyph. If you set the <CODE>symbol</CODE> keyword to <CODE>true</CODE>
	it will also create small caps variants of digits and symbols.
	<P>
	The outlines of the new glyph will be based on the outlines of the upper-case
	variant of the letter. These will then <B></B>be scaled so that a glyph which
	was <CODE>capheight</CODE> high will now be <CODE>scheight</CODE> high, and
	so that stems which were <CODE>ucstem</CODE> wide will be <CODE>lcstem</CODE>
	wide. Normally the ratio of stem heights is the same as the ratio of stem
	widths, but you may change that with <CODE>stem_height_factor</CODE>.
	<P>
	When it creates a new glyph it will name that glyph by appending ".sc" to
	the original lower case letter name (so "a" would become "a.sc") you may
	change the extension used with <CODE>letter_extension</CODE>. Similary symbols
	and digits will use the extension "taboldstyle", but you may change that
	with <CODE>symbol_extension</CODE>.
	<P>
	When it creates a glyph it also creates two lookups one bound to the feature
	"c2sc" and the other to "smcp". A mapping from the lower case letter to the
	small caps letter will be provided under "smcp", while a mapping from the
	upper case to the small caps under "c2sc". Symbols will have both lookup
	maps attached to the original glyph.</TD>

	<P>
	It will attempt to guess a good kerning value between the two glyphs -- a

	<CODE>stemAdd</CODE> specifies the number of em-units to add to the
	width of each stem.
	<P>
	If <CODE>stemType</CODE> is the string "horizontalVertical",
	then values must be specified for <CODE>stemHeightScale</CODE> and
	<CODE>stemWidthScale</CODE> (and may be for <CODE>stemHeightAdd,
	stemWidthAdd</CODE>). The first of these specifies scaling for the
	height of horizontal stems, and the second scaling for the width
	of vertical stems.
	<P>
	If <CODE>stemType</CODE> is the string "thickThin",
	then values must be specified for <CODE>thinStemScale</CODE>,
	<CODE>thickStemScale</CODE> and <CODE>thickThreshold</CODE>
	(and may be for <CODE>thinStemAdd, thickStemAdd</CODE>). The
	first of these specifies scaling for the width/height of thin
	stems, and the second scaling for the width/height of thick
	stems. While the <CODE>thickThreshold</CODE> argument specifies
	the size (in em-units) at which a stem is classified as "thick".
	<P>
	<P>
	If <CODE>hCounterType</CODE> is omitted, or is the string "uniform",
	then horizontal counters, and the left and right side bearings will
	all be scaled using the same rules, and <CODE>hCounterScale</CODE>
	must be specified to provide the scaling factor (while
	<CODE>hCounterAdd</CODE> may be specified).
	<P>
	If <CODE>hCounterType</CODE> is the string "nonUniform",
	then horizontal counters, and the left and right side bearings may
	all be scaled using different rules, and <CODE>hCounterScale,
	lsbScale</CODE> and <CODE>rsbScale</CODE> must be specified to
	provide the scaling factors (while <CODE>hCounterAdd, lsbAdd,</CODE>
	and <CODE>rsbAdd</CODE> may be specified).
	<P>
	If <CODE>hCounterType</CODE> is the string "center", then the left
	and right side-bearings will be set so the new glyph is centered
	within the original glyph's width. (Probably more useful for CJK
	fonts than LGC fonts).
	<P>
	If <CODE>hCounterType</CODE> is the string "retainScale", then the
	left and right side-bearings will be set so the new glyph is within
	within the original glyph's width, and the side-bearings remain in
	the same proportion to each other as before.
	<P>
	<P>
	If <CODE>vCounterType</CODE> is omitted, or is the string "mapped",
	then certain zones on the glyph may be placed at new (or the same)
	locations -- similar to BlueValues. So you can specify a zone for
	the baseline, one for the
	x-height and another for the top of capitals and ascenders (and perhaps
	a fourth for descenders). Each such zone is specified by the
	<CODE>vMap</CODE> argument which is a tuple of 3-tuples, each
	3-tuple specifying a zone with: Original location, original width, and
	final location. <strong>No default value is provided for this argument
	you must figure out all the values yourself</strong>.
	<P>
	If <CODE>vCounterType</CODE> is the string "scaled",
	then vertical counters, and the top and bottom side bearings will
	all be scaled using the same rules, and <CODE>vCounterScale</CODE>
	must be specified to provide the scaling factor (while
	<CODE>vCounterAdd</CODE> may be specified). This is probably most
	useful for CJK fonts.</TD>

  </H2>
  <P>
  If you have configured fontforge with the <CODE>--enable-pyextension</CODE>
  argument, then when fontforge installs itself it will also set itself up
  as something that can be used inside of python (up until now we have been
  talking about using python inside of fontforge).
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>./configure --enable-pyextension
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>make

</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  once you do that you can invoke all of the above fontforge commands from
  inside of python by saying:
