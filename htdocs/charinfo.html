<A NAME="Unicode">This dialog </A>allows you to set the name and unicode
encoding of a given character. If you know the name of the character then
FontForge can tell you the encoding (if you press Set From Name), similarly
if you know the encoding then FontForge can tell you the name.
<P>
The name field contains a pull down list with (possibly) several synonyms
for the name of this unicode code point.
<P>
The Glyph class field is for the opentype 'GDEF' table. You can usually leave
it set to automatic. FontForge will then figure out the class, and whether
it should be output into GDEF. You can see what FontForge does in
<A HREF="showatt.html">View-&gt;Show ATT</A>.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-comment.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="359" ALIGN="Right">You
can assign an arbetrary (unicode) <A NAME="comment">comment</A> to the character.
Simply type any text into this field. The comment is for your use, it will
not go into any generated fonts. You may also assign a color to a character
to make it stand out in the font view.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-pos.png" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="Right">There
are 6 seperate sub-dialogs to help you edit the
<A NAME="features">features</A> of the <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS and
GSUB</A> tables (some of these data can be converted into various of Apple's
AAT tables, particularly 'morx'). The first of these is the alternate
<A NAME="position">position</A> dialog which allows you to associate certain
modifications to a character's metrics with a feature in the GPOS table.
<P>
In the example at right the 'fwid' feature (full width) adds 400 units to
the character's advance width and moves it horizontally by 200 units.
<P>
A new entry in the list may be created by pressing the [New] button and a
<A HREF="#Feature-Tag">dlg</A> will pop up with fields for the metrics you
can change. It will also have a field for a feature tag, and a set of check
boxes for flags (these flags are not relevant here, but are included as an
excercise in assinine completeness.
<P>
The [Delete] and [Edit] buttons should be fairly self-explanitory. [Copy]
and [Paste] work as expected too. You can also paste something copied here
into the font view (if you wish to have the same position information available
in a large block of characters).
<P>
The <A NAME="pairwise">pairwise</A> positioning sub-dialog allows you to
change the positions of two characters when they occur next to one another.
The most common example of that is kerning (which is better done elsewhere,
the metricsview for example, but it can be done here if you really want to
do that).<BR Clear=Right>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-subs.png" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="Right"> A simple
<A NAME="substitution">substitution</A> replaces one glyph with another.
Here the glyph "one" has a substitution to "onesuperior" when the 'sups'
(Superscript) feature is invoked.
<P>
FontForge recognizes a special feature tag ' RQD' to indicate that this feature
is required for the given script/language. Such a feature will always be
applied.
<P>
You can generate a substitution most easily by draging a character from the
font view and droping it here (you will then be <A HREF="#Feature-Tag">prompted
for a feature tag</A> for the substitution table.
<P>
The <A NAME="multiple">multiple</A> and alternate substitution sub-dialogs
are very similar to this one except that they can take multiple glyph names.
In a multiple substitution sub table each glyph is replaced by several other
glyphs (sort of the reverse of a ligature), while in the alternate substitution
sub-dialog each glyph is to be replaced by exactly one glyph from a list
and the user is to be given a choice as to which glyph is to be chosen.
<BR Clear=Right>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-lig.png" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="Right"> The
<A NAME="ligature">ligature</A> field allows you to tell FontForge that the
current character is a ligature composed of several other characters. FontForge
will often be able to fill this in with the right default value, but occasionally
you may want to change it. The value should be a list of postscript character
names separated by spaces. If a character may be viewed as two different
ligatures then they may both be specified in different lines. For example
"ffi" may be viewed as a ligature of "f" "f" and "i" or of "ff" and "i".
<P>
In the example at right the "m" character is one of a set of flags stored
in the GSUB table. It indicates that combining marks should be ignored when
looking for the ligature.
<P>
The <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS and GSUB</A> tables allow further refinements
of ligatures. You may classify a ligature as: Standard, Required, Discretionary,
Historic or Fraction. Required ligatures must be replaced, Standard ligatures
should be, Discretionary ones may be, and Historic ones should only be used
int appropriate circumstances. The pull down list on the Tag field allows
you to pick what type of ligature this should be. <BR Clear=Right>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-counters.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="409" ALIGN="Right">
In complicated Asian characters, postscript has a mechanism for controlling
the width of <A NAME="CounterMasks">counters</A> between stems. These are
called counter mask
hints<IMG SRC="newcountermask.png" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="392" ALIGN="Left">.
In Latin, Cyrillic, Greek fonts only characters like "m" are allowed to have
counter masks, and only in very controlled conditions. See the description
of <A HREF="hinting.html#Counter">counter masks</A>.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="charinfo-counters.png" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="Right">
Some <A NAME="components">characters</A> (ligatures, accented characters,
Hangul syllables, etc.) are built up out of other characters (at least according
to unicode). This pane of the dlg shows the components that Unicode says
make up the current character, if those componants are in the font then you
can use FontForge's Element-&gt;Build Accented or Element-&gt;Build Composit
commands to create the current character. The information displayed here
is informative only, you may not change this field directly (it changes when
you change the unicode value or glyph name associated with this
glyph).<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
The Next and Prev buttons allow you to move from one character to the next
(if, for example, you need to enter encodings for a range of characters).
<P>
The Done (or Cancel) button only Cancels work in the current character. If
you have already used Next or Prev then those earlier changes will not be
cancelled.<BR Clear=Right>

  <A NAME="Feature-Tag">Feature Tag Dialog</A>
</H3>
<TABLE ALIGN=Right>
  <TR>
    <TD><IMG SRC="feature-tag-sub.png" WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="246" ALIGN="Top">
      <IMG SRC="feature-tag-pos.png" WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="308" ALIGN="Top"></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
These two dialogs allow you to specify an otf feature tag and all the other
impedimentia that go along with it. They are used by
<A HREF="charinfo.html#Character">Character Info</A> (above) to specify
substitutions, positions, and ligatures, as well as by
<A HREF="fontinfo.html#Anchors">Font Info</A> to specify anchor classes.
<P>
You must either specify an opentype feature tag (a four character tag like
'liga', see the section on <A HREF="gposgsub.html">GPOS and GSUB</A> for
feature tags), or an apple feature/setting value (Something like
&lt;2,2&gt; where the first number is the feature and the second the setting
for that feature).
<P>
In <A NAME="lookup-flags">addition</A> you must specify a set of
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/opentype/appendices/chapter2.jsp">flags</A>
which control the behavior of the feature. If your feature is to be used
in right to left text then select that flag. If your feature is to be used
to combine glyphs even if there are interviening mark glyphs (accents and
such) then select Ignore Combining Marks.
<P>
And a collection of scripts and languages for which the substitution will
be active. In the example above the substitution is active for the greek
script and the default language (which here means all languages as none have
been singled out for special treatment), the cyrillic script and the default
language, and the latin script and several languages.
<P>
<IMG SRC="scriptlist-pulldown.png" WIDTH="243" HEIGHT="118">
<P>
Clicking on the pulldown list produces a list of choices that are currently
used in the font. The last choice allows you to change or add to this list.
<P>
Most of the time you will want to specify that your item should be active
in just one script but in all languages of that script. For instance the
"fl" ligature should probably always be applied in the latin script, no matter
what the language is (except Turkish where ligatures should be explicitly
disabled), however there is no point in having it active for cyrillic users
as they will never see that combination of characters. On the other hand
the es-zet ligature (German double-s, &szlig;) has fallen by the wayside
in all (I think) languages but German so that ligature should only be active
for the latin script, german language.
<P>
And there are some characters that don't fall into one single script. The
same digits are used for latin, cyrillic, greek, hebrew, (sometimes arabic)
and many other script systems, so any ligatures of the digits (such as fractions)
should be available in all script systems.
<P>
The script names used by FontForge are those specified by
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/opentype/appendices/scripttags.jsp">Microsoft
and Adobe for opentype</A>. These are almost compatible with
<A HREF="http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso15924/document/dis15924.pdf">ISO
15924</A> except that all opentype scripts are in lower case (while those
in ISO 15924 all start with capital letters) and short script names (such
as "Lao") are converted to 'lao ' rather than 'Laoo'. I have extended the
set of opentype scripts with many of those in ISO 15924 by making them all
lower case (I have not used everything from ISO 15924 because it contains
script variants for things which I consider to be one script (eg. fraktur
has a seperate script tag, but I consider it to be latin). I have also guessed
at codes for Limbu, Tai Le, and Ugaritic ('limb','tail','ugrt'), which are
scripts used in Unicode but not defined in ISO 15924.
<H3>
  <A NAME="ScriptLang">The Script Language Dialog</A>
</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="scriptlist.png" WIDTH="296" HEIGHT="205" ALIGN="Left">This dialog
shows all the script and language combinations which are in use in the current
font. You may add a new combination or change an old one by pressing the
obvious buttons.
<P>
If you want to specify a script or language that FontForge doesn't know about,
then hold the control key down when pressing the [New...] or [Edit] buttons
and you will get an unparsed dlg which will allow you to enter whatever you
like (OpenType does not give a tag for the default language (it is has a
special representation which does not involve tags), but for the sake of
consistance I have assigned it the tag of 'dflt'. No 'dflt' tags will appear
in the output font, instead they will be converted to the appropirate
representation for the default language).
<P>
The language names used by FontForge are those specified by
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/opentype/appendices/languagetags.jsp">Microsoft
and Adobe for opentype</A>.
<P>
Note: In most cases the order of scripts in the list is irrelevant, but kerning
uses the initial script to determine the direction of the kern pair. So if
you have kerning on the digits, and want those to be active in both latin
and hebrew, you must use the unparsed dlg which allows you to order the scripts
yourself (or add a greek, or cyrillic script to the list (something that
comes before hebrew in alphabetic order and is left to right)).<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<H3>
  <A NAME="Script"><IMG SRC="scriptsdlg.png" WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="215" ALIGN="Right">The
  Script Dialog</A>
</H3>
<P>
This dialog shows all the scripts currently activated in this script-language
collection. If you want to add a new script to the collection hold the control
key down while clicking on the script. New scripts are added with the "default"
language selected. If you want finer control over languages (ie. want to
specify a language other than default) then double click on a script and
you will get a dialog of languages.
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="langdlg.png" WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="215" ALIGN="Left">The
  <A NAME="Language">Language</A> Dialog
</H3>
<P>
This shows all languages active in the current script in the current
script-language collection. Some languages are not meaningful in a given
script (but I don't know enough to know which to remove so I include all
possible languages and appologize for extranious information). Use the control
key to select multiple languages. At least one language must be
specified.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
