    Before you build (on  <A NAME="src-unix">unix/linux</A> based systems)

  <P>
  You must have the following packages installed before you can build:
  <UL>
    <LI><A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a> (version 4.5 or newer)

  </UL>
  <H2>
    Before you build (on a <A NAME="src-mac">mac</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
  You must insure that you have the both the X11 server and the Xcode toolchain
  installed on your system. This process is slightly different on OS/X 10.3
  &amp; 10.4
  <DL>

	<LI>
	  Keep clicking <CODE>Continue</CODE> until you get to the pane "Custom Install
	  on "Macintosh HD""
	<LI>
	  Press the arrow beside "Applications" so you get a list of them.

	  The X server lives in a package called X11User on the third install CD.
	<LI>
	  You must also install the X11SDK package on the XCode CD
	<LI>
	  And you must install the XCode tools themselves.
      </UL>
  </DL>
  <P>
  You may also want to install the
  <A HREF="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</A> package which includes many
  useful libraries (see the <A HREF="#Dependencies">dependencies</A> section
  below for more info on this)
  <P>
  You must then start up a Terminal window (the Terminal Application also lives
  in the Utilities sub-folder of the Applications folder) and be prepared to
  type commands in that window (I know, it's very un-mac-like).
  <H3>
    Special note for building prior to 10.3
  </H3>
  <P>
  OS/X has evolved over time. Certain system calls have changed. The current
  source distribution should work on any 10.3+ system.
  <P>
  If you wish to build on a 10.2 system you must say
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>./configure --with-regular-link
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  (Rather than just saying <CODE>./configure</CODE>)
  <H2>
    Before you build (on <A NAME="src-MS">MS/Windows)</A>
  </H2>
  <P>
  You must download the <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</A> environment.
  You will need
  <UL>
    <LI>
      the basic cygwin packages
    <LI>
      the X11 package
    <LI>
      the xterm package
    <LI>
      binutils
    <LI>
      the package containing gcc, make (probably called c compiler development
      or something)
    <LI>
      You may want to download some additional optional packages to provide support
      for various image formats (See the <A HREF="#Dependencies">Dependencies</A>
      section below).
  </UL>
  <P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>cygwin has a different
  approach to the file system than Windows. A filename like
  <CODE>C:\windows\fonts\arial.ttf </CODE>will be called
  <CODE>/cygdrive/c/windows/fonts/arial.ttf </CODE>under cygwin (backslashes
  are replaced by slashes, and the initial drive "<CODE>C:</CODE>" becomes
  "<CODE>/cygdrive/c</CODE>"
  <P>
  Having done that you should now be ready to build. Open a cygwin terminal
  window and be prepared to type commands in it.
  <H2>
    Building and installing from <A NAME="src-source">source</A>
  </H2>
  <H3>
    Obtaining a source <A NAME="src-distribution">distribution</A>
  </H3>
  <P>
  There are two basic ways to obtain a source distribution. One is by downloading
  an entire source tree from the web, and the other is by using the git utility
  to maintain a source tree on your machine which will be as up to date as
  possible. The former solution provides more stability, the latter provides
  access to cutting edge bugs.
  <H4>
    <A NAME="src-tarball">tarball</A>
  </H4>
  <P>
  <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fontforge/files/">Sourceforge's
  file release system </A>will contain a tarball (a file with the extension
  for .tar.bz2).
  <P>
  After you have downloaded one of these packages, either copy the tarball
  to where you are, or move to the directory containing the tarball (I can't
  provide explicit instructions here, because I don't know where your browser
  put the file) and type (do not type "$"):
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>bunzip2 fontforge*.tar.bz2
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>tar xf fontforge*.tar
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cd fontforge-*
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>
    from the <A NAME="src-git">git</A> repository
  </H4>
  <P>
  git is another version control system. To set up your own (local, read-only)
  copy of the git repository (including documentation), create a new directory,
  cd into it and type the following (do not type "$", when it asks for a password,
  just hit return):
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge.git</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  You can also
  <A HREF="http://github.com/fontforge/fontforge">browse
  the git repository</A> online. Or read the
  <A HREF="http://git-scm.com/documentation">git documentation</A>.
  <H4>
    <DEL>from the <A NAME="src-cvs">cvs</A> tree</DEL>
  </H4>
  <P>
  The cvs repository is no longer up to date. It still exists (for now) for
  historical purposes (and in case something goes wrong with git) but it is
  no longer in active service and no commits have been made to it since
  13-Feb-2011. You really want to use git, above.
  <P>
  <DEL>cvs is a nifty set of utilities which allows concurrent access to a
  source tree by many users. To set up your own (local) copy of the cvs tree
  (including documentation), create a new directory, cd into it and type the
  following (do not type "$", when it asks for a password, just hit
  return):</DEL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@fontforge.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fontforge login

  <P>
  <DEL>Once you have established a directory you may update it to obtain the
  most recent version of the source by typing:</DEL>

  <H3>
    <A NAME="src-Building">Building</A> &amp; installing it
  </H3>
  <P>
  Now you have the source installed on your system and you should be positioned
  at the top directory of that tree. You need to configure your package (this
  is a little program that figures out how to use your system), and then build
  it (do not type the "$"):
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>./autogen.sh
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>./configure
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>make
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <A NAME="su">Having</A> done this you will probably want to install what
  you have built. This should be done as root:
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>su
<FONT COLOR="Gray">password:</FONT> ******
<FONT COLOR="Gray"># </FONT>make install
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  On the mac the process is slightly different:
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>sudo make install
<FONT COLOR="Gray">password:</FONT> ******
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  While on cygwin, where there is no root, you just say:
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>make install
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H3>
    More complicated <A NAME="src-installs">installs</A>
  </H3>
  <P>
  The configure script allows you to turn off and on various features of fontforge
  that might not be appropriate for your system. Type
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>./configure --help
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  for a complete list of options. Some of the most useful are described below.
  <H4>
    Building fontforge without X
  </H4>
  <P>
  If you don't want to install X11 on your system, you can use fontforge as
  a command line tool which can execute scripts to manipulate fonts. FontForge's
  scripting language is described in detail <A HREF="scripting.html">in the
  section on scripting</A>, or the <A HREF="python.html">section on python
  scripting</A>.
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>./configure --without-x
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>
    Building fontforge to use higher precision internally
  </H4>
  <P>
  FontForge generally uses floats to represent coordinates. If you need greater
  accuracy...
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>./configure --enable-double
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>
    Building fontforge with the tile path command available
  </H4>
  <P>
  FontForge has a command which lets you tile a pattern along a path. Generally
  this is disabled as it isn't what most fonts will use, but for some decorative
  fonts it can be useful.
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>./configure --enable-tilepath
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>
    Building fontforge (also) as a python extension
  </H4>
  <P>
  If you want to write python scripts in normal python (as opposed to within
  the python embedded in fontforge)
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>./configure --enable-pyextension
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>
    Installing FontForge somewhere other than <CODE>/usr/local</CODE>
  </H4>
  <P>
  If you want to install fontforge in a different directory (say in /usr/bin)
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>./configure --prefix=/usr
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4>
    Installing <A NAME="installing-documentation-git">documentation</A> from
    the cvs tree
  </H4>
  <P>
  If you have a copy of the git repository on your system then you should be
  able to type
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray"># </FONT>make install_docs
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  Again you will probably need to be root to do this install too. Use either
  "su" or "sudo" as appropriate for your system (<A HREF="#su">see above</A>).
  <H2>
    Applying a <A NAME="patch">patch</A>
  </H2>
  <P>
  From time to time someone will report a bug or request a feature and I will
  reply by sending a patch which purports to fix the bug or implement the feature.
  But how do you use the patch file I sent?
  <P>
  patch is a standard unix utility (Try typing $ man patch, for more info)
  which will make changes to text files. I use it to modify the source files
  of FontForge.
  <P>
  So before you can apply the patch you must
  <A HREF="source-build.html#src-distribution">have the source code </A>available
  to you. If you choose to download from the git repository, then, in all
  probability, the patch will already have been applied (so you don't need
  to do anything with it). But if you download one of my tarballs then you
  will need to apply the patch:
  <BLOCKQUOTE id="shell">
    <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>bunzip2 fontforge*.tar.bz2
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>tar xf fontforge*.tar
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cd fontforge-*/fontforge
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>patch &lt;foobar.patch 
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cd ..
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>./configure
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>make
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>make install
</PRE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H2>
    <A NAME="Dependencies">Dependencies</A> (external libraries/helper programs)
  </H2>
  <P>
  FontForge tries to avoid hard dependencies. If a library is missing then
  fontforge will (in most cases, but not on cygwin) be able to continue to
  run, it will just lack whatever functionality the library provides. So if
  you don't need to import tiff images, you don't need libtiff. If you don't
  need to handle SVG fonts you don't need libxml2, etc.
  <H3>
    Executables
  </H3>
  <P>
  If you want to do autotracing around character images you should also download
  either

  </H3>
  <P>
  None is required for the proper compilation/execution of FontForge, if the
  libraries are not present they will not be used. (If the machine on which
  your executable was build didn't have them, then you must not only install
  the libraries, but <A HREF="#source">rebuild fontforge from source</A>) If
  your machine doesn't have them and you want them they are available from:

      Only important for systems with no built-in iconv(). If not present FontForge
      contains a minimal version of the library which allows it to work. But if
      you want to use libiconv you must configure it with
      <CODE>--enable-extra-encodings</CODE>, as FontForge requires Shift-JIS.
    <LI>
      <A HREF="http://freetype.sf.net/">freetype</A><BR>

    <LI>
      <A HREF="http://x.org/">libX</A><BR>
      Normally FontForge depends on the X11 windowing system, but if you are just
      interested in the scripting engines (with no user interface), it may be built
      on systems without X (the configure script should figure this out).
    <LI>
      <A HREF="http://www.cairographics.org/">libcairo</A><BR>
      Cairo handles drawing anti-aliased splines in the outline glyph view. It

  in your home directory, and then copy the font file into that subdirectory.

  <FONT COLOR="RED"><STRONG>Warning for mac users:</STRONG> pango uses opentype
  to layout complex scripts. Most fonts on the macintosh are in a different
  format -- glyphs from them will display fine (so they work for latin, greek
  cyrillic, japanese, chinese, etc.) but more complex features will probably
  not work (so Arabic and Indic scripts may not be displayed properly).</FONT>
  <P>
  In the old days there weren't many bitmap fonts with good unicode coverage
  so I provided a list of suggested fonts. That's not nearly as important now.
  But if fontconfig isn't available for you, you might want to pull down some
  old unicode bitmap fonts.

  After doing this fontforge will be able to find the docs on your system when
  you press the [F1] (or [Help]) key. If you don't do this fontforge will attempt
  to find documentation online.
