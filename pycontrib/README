In early 2013 this directory contained one file: excepthook.py.

Ben Martin added the simple directory. Many of these newly
added scripts depend on the test.sfd example font file to work.
To keep the scripts simple, they expect to be run in the directory
that contains them. So they can find the test.sfd file as
"../test.sfd" for example.

The scripts have been included here to provide some basic, small,
scripts that might help shine some light on how to perform certain
tasks using the python interface to FontForge.

The scripts are mostly setup to call fontforge on themselves when run.
So for example, while in the simple directory you should be able 
to just enter the following in a shell to run the script:

./load-font-and-show-name.py
