      FontForge has uses beyond simply creating and modifying fonts. It can convert
      from one format to another. It can extract information from the font file.
      Or it can simply show you what the font looks like without having to install
      it.

      <A NAME="widget-set"><B>Why is FontForge based on a non-standard widget

    <DD>
      I wanted a widget set that would handle Unicode reasonably well. In particular
      I thought support for bidi text was important for hebrew and arabic typography.
      As I was unaware of any widget sets that did that, I wrote my own.<BR>
      I also wanted a widget set where I could actually figure out whether the
      checkbox was checked or not checked. In far too many cases my eyes can't
      work out which is which...<BR>
      I realize now that that there are essentially two free widget sets that are
      far better at unicode support than mine. These are
      <A HREF="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt">QT</A> and
      <A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/">gtk</A>. I'm still not using either because:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Converting from one set of widgets to another is tedious. And people send
	  me bugs which distract me.
	<LI>
	  QT is written in C++, and, <A HREF="faq.html#C-plus-plus">as I explain
	  below</A>, I don't like C++, so that's out.
	<LI>
	  The more I look at gtk the less I like it.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      The support for images is atrocious (which is odd, since it was written for
	      gimp):
	      <UL>
		<LI>
		  There is no support whatsoever for client side bitmaps (and I want to support
		  bitmap fonts)
		<LI>
		  Colors are ordered RGB in color tables for index images, but BGR for 24bit
		  color images
		<LI>
		  No simple support for transparent images without resorting to full RGBA images,
		  which is a bit of overkill when I want to draw a simple bitmap.
		<LI>
		  There is no overarching format for images, so I can't have an image which
		  itself knows whether it's bitmap, index or truecolor.
		<LI>
		  Fixing thesewais possible, but it involved a lot of very low level work on
		  my part -- and I only know how to do that work on X.

	      I find the file chooser dialog really ugly. And it's so complex I can't figure
	      out how to modify it to make it look nice.
	    <LI>
	      I also can't figure out how to modify the file chooser to make it behave
	      the way the fontforge's file chooser currently behaves (popup windows showing
	      FontNames as you move the mouse over fontfiles, a pull down list of recently
	      used files attached to the filename input box, etc.)

	      gtk+2 doesn't run natively on Mac OS, and the only people porting gtk to

	      widgets are better after all.

      <A NAME="C-plus-plus"><B>Why isn't FontForge written in C++ (or <I>Why C++
      is not my favorite language</I>)?</B></A>
    <DD>
      I've been a little surprised to be asked this question, I had not realized
      my choice of language needed justification, but it appears to do so...
      <P>
      Basically because I don't find object-oriented practices helpful in most
      cases, because I find C++ far too complex and badly designed, and because
      I can't debug it easily.
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  I grew up with SIMULA and dabbled with SmallTalk and found after a few years
	  that there were very few problems where an object oriented approach seemed
	  natural to me. In most cases it just seemed to impose unneeded complexities
	  on the problem.
	<LI>
	  The semantics of a C++ program cannot be specified. The compiler is free
	  to generate temporaries as it wishes. In C this is not a problem, but in
	  C++ the creation of a temporary can involve calling a constructor and a
	  destructor which may have untold side-effects. I find this frightening.
	<LI>
	  The order of execution of external constructors is unspecified. I have seen
	  many inexplicable bugs caused by this
	<LI>
	  I find it extremely difficult to debug C++. Stepping through a statement
	  often involves many unexpected procedure calls (some of which are inlined
	  and not obvious). This distracts from my main purpose in debugging.
	<LI>
	  Finally I find the language badly specified and too complex. Its various
	  concepts do not fit well together. Each compiler seems to do things slightly
	  differently.
	  <P>
	  I first met C++ in about 1981 when it was called C with Classes. I wrote
	  the C++ front end for Green Hills Software's compiler suite from 1987 to
	  1994 and I tracked each new version of the language from 1.1 to ANSI.
	  <P>
	  Each version added new features which did not sit well with the old ones.
	  Each version was badly specified. The reference implementation was wildly
	  different from the specification. For example the behavior of virtual functions
	  inside constructors was not specified until version 2 of the language and
	  since this behavior was different from naive expectations this caused bugs.
	  My favorite confusion occurred in (I think it was) the version 2.1 specification
	  where on one page, within a few paragraphs, the following two sentences occurred:
	  "Unions may contain member functions." and "Unions may not contain member
	  functions.".
      </UL>
      <P>
      The above are my personal opinions based on my experience and explain why
      <I>I</I> do not use C++. Your opinions may differ, few people have spent
      5 years writing C++ compilers.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="legal"><B>Is it legal to modify a font? Is it ethical?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Legal matters vary from country to country (and perhaps within countries).
      You really should consult a lawyer for a definitive answer. Here are some
      guide lines:
      <P>
      Look at the license agreement you received with the font and see what it
      has to say on this issue.
      <P>
      TrueType (and OpenType and potentially CID-keyed fonts) have a field in the
      OS/2 table called FSType which allows the font designer to place restrictions
      on what other people can do with the font. If this field prohibits modification
      fontforge will ask you to make sure you have an agreement with the font designer
      which supersedes this field.
      <P>
      My understanding of US law (but check with a lawyer before relying on this)
      is that:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  There is no legal protection for font designs. So legally in the US glyph
	  images may be traced. Obviously this is not ethical if the font designer
	  is currently alive.
	<LI>
	  Font programs (such as a postscript or truetype font file, but not a bitmap
	  font file) may be copyrighted.
	<LI>
	  Font names may be trademarked.
      </UL>
      <P>
      My understanding is that in most European countries there are laws against
      copying the design (the shape) of a font.
      <P>
      I would welcome any additions or corrections here, as well as info on the
      laws governing fonts in other countries.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="pointsize"><B>What is a 12 point font?</B></A> <B>(What measurement
      of the font determines the point size?)</B>
    <DD>
      <IMG SRC="pointsize.png" WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="96" ALIGN="Right">A font is
      12 points high if the distance between the baselines of two adjacent lines
      of (unleaded) text is 12 points.
      <P>
      The pointsize is not based on the sizes of any of the glyphs of the font.
      <P>
      Back when fonts were made out of metal, the pointsize of the font was the
      height of the metal slugs used for that font.
      <P>
      In some sense this is not a very good measure of the size of a font (some
      fonts may allow more room for accents or ascenders or descenders than others
      meaning that the height of the actual glyphs will be smaller).
      <P>
      There is also a measurement scheme based on the x-height of the glyphs.
      <P>
      In England and the US a point has traditionally meant the pica point (1/72.27th
      of an inch), while in Europe the point has been the didot point (1/67.54th
      of an inch). The Europeans have a slightly larger point, but the glyphs of
      English and European fonts appear the same size. English does not use accents
      (except in very rare cases) while most European languages do, and the slight
      increase in the size of the point allows more room for accents.
      <P>
      (Of course now most Europeans are probably forced to use the pica point by
      their desktop software, while most computer fonts now contain accented glyphs,
      so the distinction and the reason for it may have vanished).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="linespace"><B>How do I set the line spacing on a font?</B></A>
    <DD>
      It depends on the kind of font you are generating, the operating system under
      which you are running, and luck.
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  For Type1 fonts there is no way to set the line spacing. Applications will
	  often take the values specified in the font's bounding box and use those
	  to set the line spacing. This is a really bad idea on their part, but it
	  is common practice.
	<LI>
	  For True/Open Type fonts the answer is complicated.
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      On the mac<BR>
	      The line spacing is set by the ascender and descender values of the 'hhea'
	      table. These in turn are set to the bounding box values of the font. Not
	      a good choice.
	    <LI>

	      Line spacing is supposed to be set to the Typo Ascent/Typo Desent values
	      specified in the OS/2 table. And these in turn are supposed to sum to the
	      emsize. (FontForge sets these values to the ascent/descent values you specify
	      for your font). Unfortunately most windows applications don't follow this
	      rule, and instead set them to the Win Ascent/Descent values of the OS/2 table.
	      These values are supposed to specify a clipping region for the font (not
	      line spacing). The clipping region should be as big as the font's bounding
	      box, but in some cases needs to be bigger.
	      <P>
	      (The clipping region should be bigger than the bounding box if a GPOS lookup

    <DD>
      Unfortunately this seemingly simple question cannot be answered. Your glyphs
      may be any size. Outline glyphs may be scaled and even bitmap glyphs will
      be different sizes depending on the screen resolution.
      <P>
      Suppose instead that you have an outline font that you draw at 12 points.
      Then we can answer the question.
      <P>
      Suppose you have a dash glyph that is 500 internal units long, and the font
      has an em-size of 1000 units. Then your glyph will be 500/1000 * 12 = 6points
      long. On a 72 dpi screen this will mean the dash is 6 pixels long.
      <P>
      <B>What are em-units? (internal units?)</B>
      <P>
      When you create your font you can use
      <A HREF="fontinfo.html#PS-General" TARGET="_top">Element-&gt;Font
      Info-&gt;General</A> to provide an em-size for your font. This is the sum
      of the typographic ascent and descent (in the days of metal fonts, the height
      of the metal slugs, the baseline to baseline distance). Generally the em-size
      will be 1000 or 2048. This gives you the number of internal units (also called
      em-units) used to represent em.
      <P>
      Within fontforge outline glyphs are displayed using the coordinate system
      established here. See also the

      When it loads a font FontForge expands it into a more intuitive (well intuitive
      to me) format which is much easier to edit. But is much bigger.

      It would probably be possible to rewrite FontForge to use a more efficient

      interest me.

      Sfd files are large because they are an ASCII representation of this same

	  Essentially you designate one (or several) directories as a "font directory".
	  You move your fonts to that directory. You build up certain data structures
	  that X needs, and you tell X to include this directory in your font path.
	  Sadly different versions of X and the X font server use slightly different
	  conventions. You may need to alter these procedures a bit.
	  <P>
	  For example, if you want to install a <EM>bdf font </EM>called frabnuts-13.bdf

	  </UL>

	  <P>
	  Some versions of X (ie, those shipped by redhat) rely on the x font server
	  to do font work rather than the X server itself. You may need to use chkfontpath
	  to add your new directory to the font server's font path (rather than xset
	  fp).<BR>
	  You may also need to insure that the font directory (and all its parent

	  user)
	  <P>
	  I haven't seen anything that says X supports <EM>opentype</EM> fonts yet,
	  but since freetype does (and I think X's rasterizer uses freetype) then X
	  might support them too. Installing them will require manual editing of

      For the Style menu in most mac applications to work on your fonts, you must

      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="filemenu.html#GenerateMac">File-&gt;Generate Mac
      Family</A> command.
      <P>
      All the fonts in a family must have the same Family name (See the
      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="fontinfo.html">font info</A> dialog). Font Families
      are handled rather differently under Carbon (the old font handling mechanism
      used in OS 9) and under ATSUI (on OS/X).
      <P>
      Under Carbon, the font family is limited by the design of the Mac 'FOND'
      resource, which reflects the computer font technology of the early 1980s.
      Modern computer fonts often have variants that can't be expressed in it.
      FONDs support any combination (except one containing both Extend and Condense)
      of the following styles:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Bold
	<LI>
	  Italic
	<LI>
	  Condense
	<LI>
	  Extend
	<LI>
	  Underline
	<LI>
	  Shadow
	<LI>
	  Outline
      </UL>
      <P>
      Mac FONDS do not support "Black", "DemiBold", "Light", "Thin" or
      "Extra-Condensed" variants.
      <P>
      Under ATSUI, on the other hand, a family seems to consist of all fonts in
      a given resources file which have the same FamilyName.
      <P>
      In order that a family be useful under both systems, Apple appears to place
      several FONDs inside such a font file. Each FOND contains a sub-family of
      related fonts. The 'FOND's appear to be distributed as follows:
      <P>
      Suppose you have a family of fonts with the following styles:<BR>
      Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold-Italic, Condense, Condense-Italic, Oblique, Light,
      Light-Italic, Black<BR>
      Then you should create a font family with the styles that the FOND does support,
      which in this case would be<BR>
      Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold-Italic, Condense, Condense-Italic<BR>
      For each of these use
      <A HREF="fontinfo.html#FONDName" TARGET="_top">Element-&gt;Font
      Info-&gt;Mac</A> to set the FondName field to the font's family name.
      <P>
      Change the fondname of the other styles, so that the Oblique style has Oblique
      in the fond name, the two Light styles have Light in the fond name, and so
      on. Set the <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Mac-Style" TARGET="_top">Mac Style</A>
      on the "Light" variant of the font to be Regular (everything unselected)
      and set the style of the "Light-Italic" variant to be "Italic" -- that is,
      forget about the "Light", the FOND can't handle it, that's why we moved it
      into its own family.
      <P>
      Having done this setup, the <A HREF="filemenu.html#GenerateMac">Generate
      Mac Family </A>command should be able to put all the fonts into appropriate
      FONDs, and then place all the FONDs into one file, which the Mac should interpret

      This is really a limitation on ATM's part and there's nothing FontForge can

      If you generate a font with an encoding other than Macintosh Latin, then

	  Yes. The kerning information is stored in either the 'kern' or 'GPOS' tables
	  of these fonts and FontForge can read them (Apple has made a number of extensions

	<DT>
	  <B>PostScript Type1 fonts anywhere other than the Mac.</B>
	<DD>
	  The kerning information is not stored in a Type 1 font file. Instead it is
	  stored in a file with the same filename as the font file but with the extension
	  ".afm". When FontForge reads a PostScript font it will check for an associated

	  <B>PostScript Type1 fonts on the Mac.</B>
	<DD>
	  No. Again the kerning information is not stored in the font file (it is stored

	  to use for the associated bitmap file, and FontForge does not even try. <BR>

	  The mac stored kerning information in the <A NAME="FOND-kern">FOND</A> resource

      There are a number of similarities between the results achieved by these

      The simple answer is that this is pretty much automatic. You load an apple

      FontForge will convert any non-contextual features where Apple's feature/setting

      Both PostScript and TrueType require that glyphs be drawn in a clockwise
      fashion. Some rasterizers don't care. But other rasterizers will have
      difficulties with counter-clockwise paths and produced stems of different
      widths when they should be the same, or fuzzy stems, or even nothing at all.
      The solution to this is to run Element-&gt;Correct Direction on all your

      You don't. Just insure that all the glyphs in the font have the same width
      and then FontForge will automatically mark it as monospaced for you. (If
      you mark it as monospaced incorrectly some rasterizers will give strange
      results).<BR>
      If you want to set a font's panose values yourself
      (<A HREF="fontinfo.html#Panose" TARGET="_top">Element-&gt;Font
      Info-&gt;OS/2-&gt;Panose</A>) then set the Proportion field to Monospaced.
      This is necessary but not sufficient to mark the font as a whole as monospaced.

      <A NAME="new-encoding"><B>How I do tell fontforge about a new

      First ask yourself if you really need a new encoding? If you are using OpenType
      or TrueType fonts you can usually get by with the standard unicode encoding.
      But if you really need a new one here is a rough idea of what to do:
      <P>
      Figure out what your encoding looks like. Often this will involve searching
      around the web to find an example of that encoding. For instance if you want
      a devanagari encoding you might look at
      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/indic.html">a
      site which shows the ISCII encodings</A>
      <P>
      These encodings only show the top 96 characters, presumably the others are
      the same as US ASCII. Look at the images and figure out how they map to unicode
      (or more precisely what the appropriate postscript names are for those
      characters).
      <P>
      Create a file (call it "Devanagari.ps" in this case). It should start with
      a line:
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE>/Devanagari {
</PRE>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>
      This tells FontForge that the encoding is called "Devanagari", then follow
      this with a list of all the character names (preceded by a slash). We start
      with ASCII which starts with 32 .notdef characters, then space, etc.
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE>/Devanagari {
 /.notdef

      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      Now load this file into FontForge's list of encodings with Encoding-&gt;Load

	<DT>
	  Delta

	<DT>
	  mu
	<DD>
	  is assigned to U+00B5, "MICRO SIGN", rather than U+03BC, "GREEK SMALL LETTER
	  MU", probably because Micro Sign was part of ISO-Latin1 and MacRoman
	<DT>
	  omega1
	<DD>
	  Unicode calls this glyph "GREEK PI SYMBOL". It looks like an omega though.
	<DT>
	  Tcommaaccent, tcommaaccent

	  are assigned to U+0162,U+0163 "LATIN CAPITAL/SMALL LETTER T WITH CEDILLA",
	  rather than U+021A,U+021B "LATIN CAPITAL/SMALL LETTER T WITH COMMA BELOW",
	  probably because of a confusion in the early Unicode spec.
	<DT>
	  dotlessj
	<DD>
	  is assigned to U+F6BE (in the private use area) rather than U+0237 "LATIN
	  SMALL LETTER DOTLESS J", because Adobe saw the need for a dotlessj glyph
	  before Unicode did and assigned a slot in the private use area. Then in 4.1
	  Unicode added the glyph to the standard.

    <DT>
      <A NAME="Open-size"><B>Why isn't my Open Type font much smaller than the

      This is probably because you didn't round to int before saving the font.
      FontForge will save the font using fixed point numbers which take up a lot
      more space than normal integers.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Open-difference"><B>What's the difference between OpenType and
      PostScript (or TrueType) fonts?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Both PostScript and TrueType define a file format and a glyph format. OpenType
      uses the TrueType file format with a PostScript glyph format (actually OpenType
      includes the TrueType glyph format as well, but the OpenType definition says
      such fonts should still be called TrueType fonts so I ignore that aspect).
      <P>
      The PostScript used in OpenType is slightly different from that used in .pfa
      and .pfb files. pfa/b files are Type1 fonts while OpenType uses Type2 fonts.
      Type2 is almost a superset of Type1 with a few minor changes and many extensions.
      Adobe's subroutine based extensions to Type1 (flex hints, hint substitution,
      counter hints) have been added to Type2 as direct instructions.<BR>
      OpenType can also include additional information (see
      <A HREF="#AAT-Open">below</A>) that allows for the layout of complex scripts
      (Arabic, Indic, etc.) as when as support for glyph variants and other aspects
      of fine typography.

      <A NAME="AAT-Open"><B>What is the difference between AAT (Apple Advanced

      Both of these are extensions to the basic TrueType font which can contain
      information for laying out complex scripts (like Arabic or Indic scripts)
      as well as support for glyph variants and other aspects of fine typography.
      They use totally different internal formats for the more complex aspects
      of this task, formats which have different expressive powers so that neither
      format can be converted to the other without the possibility for some loss
      of information. I discuss this in greater detail

    <DD>
      With Tiger (Mac OS/X.4) Apple added some support for OpenType. Some OpenType
      features are converted (at runtime) into AAT features. This is good, but
      not all features have corresponding Apple feature/settings, and not all lookups
      can be converted (conditional lookups cannot be). Unfortunately if a font
      contains both OpenType and AAT features Apple now ignores the AAT features
      (or so I have been told). The result is that AAT features, which presumably
      work, will not be used, while OpenType features, which are not completely
      supported and so won't work, are used instead.

      <A NAME="save-no-change"><B>After I generate a font and quit, why does FontForge

    <DD>
      There are two reasons why this might be happening.
      <OL>
	<LI>
	  Even though you haven't changed anything in this session, FontForge may need
	  to (re)generate hinting information on one or several glyphs (if, for example
	  those glyphs have been changed (in an earlier session) but no hints have
	  been generated for them since). These new hints will mark the font as changed.
	<LI>
	  If your font has an XUID field in the Font Info, then FontForge will increment
	  the final number in the XUID each time a postscript font is generated --
	  and this also counts as a change. (Why does FontForge do this? Because Adobe
	  says it should. A minor annoyance, but it avoids some problems with font
	  caching when you change an old version of the font for a new one).
      </OL>
    <DT>
      <B><A NAME="TeX">Why doesn't TeX work with my fonts?</A></B>
    <DD>
      I'm a total novice with TeX. I am told that TeX (or some part of the TeX
      chain, dvips perhaps) expects fonts to be encoded in TeX base Encoding --
      sometimes called "Adobe Standard" by the TeX docs, but it isn't it's TeX
      base. So if you are having printing problems, missing glyphs, etc. try changing
      the encoding of your font to TeX Base (Go to Element-&gt;Font Info, select
      the Encoding tab, select TeX Base from the pulldown list).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="mf-files"><B>Why doesn't FontForge let me edit an '.mf'
      file?</B></A>
    <DD>
      As Knuth said "(the problem with WSYWYG is that...) What you see is
      <I>all</I> you get." FontForge suffers from this.
      <P>
      Let us take a simple example. Suppose we have a point defined by<BR>
      <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;top<SUB>1</SUB>y<SUB>2</SUB> = CapHeight</CODE><BR>
      And the user tries to drag point 2 to a new y location. How should FontForge
      interpret this? It could:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Change <CODE>CapHeight</CODE>
	<LI>
	  Change the width of pen 1
	<LI>
	  Change the equation to something like:<BR>
	  <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp;top<SUB>1</SUB>y<SUB>2</SUB> = CapHeight - 30</CODE>
	<LI>
	  Or to something like:<BR>
	  <CODE>&nbsp; &nbsp;top<SUB>1</SUB>y<SUB>2</SUB> = (CapHeight +
	  XHeight)/2</CODE>
	<LI>
	  Or to half a dozen other things.
      </UL>
      <P>
      So FontForge's method for moving a point around is ambiguous. And I haven't
      been able to come up with any reasonable way for disambiguating it. Suggestions
      are welcome (but there's no guarantee they'll be implemented).

      Some window managers (gnome-sawtooth for one) steal meta (alt) clicks from

      Adobe was thinking more of backwards compatibility than sense when they assigned
      the names of the greek letters in their unicode encoding. Thus the name "mu"
      refers to the Micro Sign (U+00B5) and not to the letter mu. They also assigned
      Delta to Increment, and Omega to Ohm Sign.
      <P>
      <P>
      Adobe has also decided that the character at U+03D6 (said by the Unicode

      "pi1" seems more appropriate.

      <P>
      Then they started thinking about CJK fonts (and perhaps Unicode), which have
      huge glyph sets, and coming up with reasonable ASCII names for 10,000 glyphs
      was <SMALL>a)</SMALL> a waste of space, <SMALL>b)</SMALL> fairly meaningless.
      So then adobe created CID-keyed fonts which have no glyph names and no encodings.
      Every glyph has an index (a CID), which is just a number, and this is sort
      of treated as a name. Then external to the font is an additional resource
      (a cmap) which provides the encoding for the font (and can support really
      grungy encoding schemes like SJIS), by mapping a sequence of input bytes
      to a CID.
      <P>
      Adobe provides certain standard cmap resources (ie. one for SJIS, one for
      JIS, one for Extended Unix whatever). Because these files are fairly painful
      to write Adobe has assigned standard meanings to CIDs so that everyone can
      use the same cmap file. -- Well actually there are 5 or 6 different standards,
      Japanese (JIS208), Japanese (JIS212), Korean, Chinese (Hong Kong, Taiwan),
      Chinese (Mainland, Singapore), Identity (Unicode) -- So CID 1 might be space,
      CID 2 might be "!", CID 935 might be "Katakana ka", etc.
      <P>
      My cidmap files just give me a mapping between Adobe's CIDs and Unicode.
      This allows FontForge to know what glyph it is working on. If they aren't
      present things should work ok, but FontForge would fill the font view with
      "?" rather than the appropriate glyph. And FontForge wouldn't be able to
      reencode the font into Unicode or anything else.
      <P>
      <P>
      So the cidmap files are only useful for people working on CID keyed CJK fonts.
      So many europeans/americans won't need them.

      <B>Does the <A NAME="simplify">simplify</A> command lose accuracy?</B>
    <DD>
      Yes it does.<BR>
      But not much.<BR>
      It is designed to replace a set of splines with another spline that nowhere
      differs from the original by more than one unit in the local coordinate
      system.<BR>
      If this level of accuracy is not good enough then (In the outline view):
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  Edit-&gt;Select-&gt;Select All
	<LI>
	  Element-&gt;Transform-&gt;Transform
	<LI>
	  Scale Uniformly: 1000%
	<LI>
	  OK
	<LI>
	  Simplify
	<LI>
	  Element-&gt;Transform-&gt;Transform
	<LI>
	  Scale Uniformly: 10%
	<LI>
	  OK
      </UL>
      <P>
      This will replace a set of splines with a spline that differs from the original
      by no more than .1 unit.

      <A NAME="cubic-quadratic"><B>How does FontForge convert a cubic spline into
      a quadratic spline for truetype?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Again this can involve a loss of accuracy.<BR>
      First FontForge checks to see if the spline happens to be a quadratic already
      (this would happen if you'd just read in a truetype font, or if a miracle
      occurred when you generated the spline).<BR>
      Otherwise FontForge will divide the original spline into smaller chunks and
      try to find a set of quadratic splines that differ from the cubic by no more
      than one unit anywhere. (Once you have picked two end-points and know the
      slope at those end-points there is only one quadratic spline possible between
      the two).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="quadratic-cubic"><B>How does FontForge convert a quadratic spline
      into a cubic (when reading truetype)?</B></A>
    <DD>
      This is easy since any quadratic spline can already be represented as a cubic,
      it will just happen that the cubic term is always 0.
    <DT>
      <B><A NAME="dynamic-libs">Why does fontforge say "Error loading dynamic library"
      when trying to import an image file?</A></B>
    <DD>
      FontForge depends on certain dynamic libraries to load images. It does not
      check for the existance of these libraries until you actually try to load
      an image. If the library has not been installed on your system it will give
      the above error (and fail to load the image).<BR>
      The <A HREF="source-build.html#Dependencies" TARGET="_top">Dependencies</A>
      section of the main page describes how to find these libraries.<BR>
      If the libraries are installed and you still get this message try setting
      your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to the directory containing the library in
      question (On the mac this is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH).
    <DT>
      <B><A NAME="complex-eps">Why does fontforge say "EPS file is too complex
      to be understood"?</A></B>
    <DD>
      (Well because it is a misquotation of Shakespeare, and how could I pass that
      up? <I>Much Ado About Nothing, V . i. 217</I>)<BR>
      Most programs which load eps files treat them as black boxes. They will read
      the file into memory and output it, unchanged, to a postscript printer.
      Unfortunately FontForge cannot do this. FontForge needs to understand and
      then convert the eps file into a simpler format (fonts can use far fewer
      operations than an eps file). So unlike most programs FontForge must interpret
      each eps file -- but interpretting all of PostScript is a huge job and ff
      is limited in what it understands. Sometimes it will find a file it can't
      handle.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="default-char"><B>How do I set the default glyph of a font?</B></A>
    <DD>
      If the glyph at encoding 0 is named ".notdef" and if it contains some splines
      (but no references) then it will be used as the default glyph (that is the
      glyph used when an unencoded glyph is called for).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="ttf-degrade"><B>I loaded a ttf font, made a few changes and generated
      a new font. The changed glyphs don't look anywhere near as nice as the originals.
      Why?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Unfortunately FontForge does not hint truetype fonts at all well. And when
      FontForge reads in a truetype font it saves all the hinting (instructions)
      that were present in the original. But if you change a glyph in any significant
      way those instructions are no longer valid (they depend intimately on the
      details of the outlines), so FontForge removes them when you make a change.
      The result is that changing a glyph with FontForge will degrade its appearance
      in most truetype fonts (not all, some have no hints).<BR>
      FontForge can hint vertical and horizontal stems, but not diagonals. In many
      glyphs FontForge's attempt at hinting makes things worse (because the diagonals
      don't match the horizontals/verticals). So if you want this to happen you
      must explicitly call the Hints-&gt;AutoInstr command.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="otf-diffs"><B>I generated an opentype font and windows wouldn't
      install it. Why not?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Unfortunately Apple and MicroSoft (and Adobe) do not agree on the proper
      format for open and truetype fonts. FontForge has a check box on the Generate
      Font Options dialog labelled [] Apple. Make sure this is checked when you
      are generating a font for the mac. Make sure this is not checked when generating
      a font for Windows (and probably for unix too, though unix tends to be less
      picky).
      <P>
      The major differences I've stumbled onto so far are:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The postscript name entry in the NAME table.
	<LI>
	  The names of the tables containing bitmap fonts
	<LI>
	  The way scaled references are stored
	<LI>
	  And the tables containing advanced typographical features are completely
	  different
      </UL>
    <DT>
      <A NAME="DSIG"><B>I have a truetype font with opentype tables, but windows
      displays the "TT" (truetype) icon and not the "O" icon. Why?</B></A>
    <DD>
      As far as I can tell Windows will mark a truetype font with the "O" icon
      if that font contains a 'DSIG' (Digital Signature) table. FontForge does
      not produce digital signatures (I think they are of negative utility, and
      anyway I don't know how to create them).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="mingliu"><B>I looked at kaiu.ttf or mingliu.ttf and the outlines
      looked nothing like the correct glyphs. What's wrong?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Some truetype fonts (kaiu and mingliu are examples) do not store the correct
      outline. Instead they rely on using the instructions to move points around
      to generate the outline. The outline does not appear to be grid-fit at all,
      just positioned. FontForge will not process the instructions as it reads
      the font. In most fonts this would be the wrong thing to do, and I don't
      know how I could tell when it needs to be done...
    <DT>
      <A NAME="greek-accents"><B>When I use Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Accented
      Glyph to build one of the Extended Greek glyphs (U+1F00-U+1FFF) FontForge
      picks the wrong accents. Why?</B></A>
    <DD>
      For some reason Unicode has unified greek and latin accents even though they
      don't look at all alike. When FontForge follows the simplistic unicode
      definitions it will probably pick a latin accent for greek glyphs. Fortunately
      Unicode also contains code points for the greek accents starting around U+1FBD,
      if you fill these code points with the appropriate accents then FontForge
      will use these rather than the latin accents.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="u-accents"><B>When I use Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Accented Glyph
      to build accents over "u" or "y" I get the accent over one of the stems not
      centered on the glyph. Why?</B></A>
    <DD>
      One of your stems is a little taller than the other. FontForge centers accents
      over the tallest point on the glyph. If there are several points with the
      same height, then an average is used.
      <P>
      If you make all your stems be the same height then the accent should be properly
      centered.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="ttf2afm"><B>Why does ttf2afm crash on FontForge ttf files?</B></A>
    <DD>
      I don't know. The ttf2afm that was distributed with my redhat 7.3 linux certainly
      did crash. When I downloaded the source from
      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/systems/pdftex/">pdftex</A>
      area of ctan and built it (with debug) the resultant program did not crash.
      Therefore I believe this is a bug in ttf2afm and that bug has been fixed.<BR>
      The afm files produced by ttf2afm don't conform to
      <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/5004.AFM_Spec.pdf">Adobe's
      specifications</A>.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="memory"><B>My system keeps crashing because FontForge keeps running
      out of memory. What can I do about it?</B></A>
    <DD>
      Buy more memory?
      <P>
      If you are editing large fonts, FontForge may run out of memory. All too
      often when FF runs out of memory, the kernel will crash rather than report
      an error condition. FontForge does check for failure to allocate and attempts
      to free up some chunks of memory when the system returns an error -- I've
      never seen this code activated though.
      <P>
      FontForge does provide a mechanism which might help you avoid this. FontForge
      generally wastes a lot of memory keeping undoes around. You can clear undoes
      associated with a glyph with the Edit-&gt;Remove Undoes command. You can
      also limit the number of undoes that will be stored with each glyph with
      the File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Editing-&gt;UndoDepth.

      I don't bother much with doing QA. This is a problem. I don't enjoy doing
