  <P>
  This dialog allows you to select glyphs which undergo a transformation described
  in the selected lookup subtable.
  <P>
  There are three variants on how the search behaves:
  <OL>
    <LI>
      The selection will be set to whatever glyphs match the search criteria
    <LI>
      The selection will be expanded. Anything that was previously selected will
      remain so, and anything that matches the search criteria will become selected.
    <LI>
      The selection will be restricted. Only glyphs previously selected will be
      searched, the selection will be restricted to those which match<BR>
      So if you want to search for all ligatures containing both "f" and "i"...<BR>
      Search for ligatures containing "f" with "&lt;*&gt; Select Results" set<BR>
      Then Search for ligatures containing "i" with &lt;*&gt; Restrict Selection"
      set
  </OL>
