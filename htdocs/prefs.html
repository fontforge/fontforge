      <A NAME="ResourceFile">ResourceFile</A>
    <DD>
      FontForge will read <A HREF="xres.html">X Resources</A> from a property on
      the screen. But sometimes this isn't enough. You set this preference item
      to specify a file from which these resources should be read (those on the
      screen will also be read and will supersede those in the file).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="HelpDir">HelpDir</A>
    <DD>
      FontForge will search this directory for help files when the user presses
      [F1].
    <DT>
      <A NAME="OtherSubrsFile">OtherSubrsFile</A>
    <DD>
      Allows you to redefine the OtherSubrs routines used in type1 fonts. The file
      format is described at the scripting command
      <A HREF="scripting-alpha.html#ReadOtherSubrsFile">ReadOtherSubrsFile</A>.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="FreeTypeInFontView">FreeTypeInFontView</A>
    <DD>
      Normally FontForge will use the freetype library to generate glyphs for display
      in the fontview. This is a bit slower, but creates better images than using
      FontForge's built-in rasterizer. This preference item allows you to control
      whether to use freetype or FontForge's own rasterizer.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="FreeTypeAAFillInOutlineView">FreeTypeAAFillInOutlineView</A>
    <DD>
      In the <A HREF="charview.html">outline glyph view</A>, FontForge
      can generate glyph filles using many techniques. If FontForge is
      using the freetype library for this, you can enable this option
      to have FontForge generate fills with anti aliased edges. The
      old default was not to antialias in order to save some RAM.
    <DT>
      SplashScreen
    <DD>
      Controls whether a splash screen is displayed on start up.
    <DT>
      UseCairoDrawing
    <DD>
      FontForge can use its own drawing routines, or rely on Cairo library in the
      <A HREF="charview.html">outline glyph view</A>. Using Cairo is slower, but
      gives smooth curves, and subpixel display precision. New setting applies
      only to windows created afterwards.<BR Clear=all>

      <A NAME="NewCharset">NewCharset</A>

      The default encoding used to create new fonts. Normally this is ISO 8859-1.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="NewEmSize">NewEmSize</A>
    <DD>
      Specifies the default number of em-units in the em-square. For PostScript
      fonts this should be 1000, for truetype fonts it should be a power of two
      (often 512, 1024 or 2048 will be used).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="NewFontsQuadratic">NewFontsQuadratic</A>
    <DD>
      Splines in fonts may be either in quadratic or cubic format. TrueType fonts
      use quadratic splines while PostScript (and OpenType) fonts use cubic splines.
      When FontForge generates a font it will convert from whatever format is used
      internally to whatever format is required for the font, so there will be
      no problem if this is set incorrectly, but setting it correctly for your
      font means you get a clearer idea of what the outlines will look like.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="LoadedFontsAsNew">LoadedFontsAsNew</A>
    <DD>
      When FontForge reads in a font it will generally keep the splines in the
      format they used in the font (that is quadratic for truetype fonts and cubic
      for postscript). If you set this flag then all loaded fonts will have the
      same file format as that specified by NewFontsQuadratic above.<BR Clear=all>

      <A NAME="PreferCJKEncoding">PreferCJKEncoding</A>
    <DD>
      This controls the loading of truetype and opentype fonts. If a font contains
      both an unicode encoding subtable and a cjk subtable, then this item allows
      you to pick which one FontForge will choose to decode.
    <DT>
      AskUserForCMap
    <DD>
      When loading an sfnt (truetype, opentype font file), ask the user which cmap
      encoding s/he would like to use.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="PreserveTables">PreserveTables</A>
    <DD>
      A string containing a list of 4 letter table tags separated by commas. When
      loading an SFNT (ttf/otf) file, any table in the font with one of these tags
      will be preserved without interpretation. (Note: If FontForge thinks it
      understands the table it will parse it rather than preserving it).
    <DT>
      SeekCharacter
    <DD>
      A unicode character (or a hex name for a unicode character, so either "A"
      or "U+0041"), fontforge will attempt to scroll the display to this character
      when it opens a font.
    <DT>
      CompactOnOpen
    <DD>

    <DD>
      In the glyph window this controls how ff behaves when the user types a normal
      character. If this is On then when a normal character is typed the glyph
      window will shift to display that character, if Off typed characters will
      trigger actions associated with that character as a hotkey or be ignored.
      For example the default action associated with ` as a hotkey is to trigger
      Preview mode while that key is pressed.

      OpenCharsInNewWindow
    <DD>
      Double clicking on a glyph in a <A HREF="fontview.html">font view</A> can

      <A NAME="SnapDistance">SnapDistance</A>
    <DD>
      The maximum distance at which pointer motion in the glyph view will be snapped
      to an interesting object (ie. a point, baseline, width line, etc.). This
      is measured in pixels.
    <DT>
      SnapToInt
    <DD>
      When positioning points and control points, the mouse will move to the nearest
      integral value. This is useful in editing TrueType (or PostScript if you
      wish to save space in the font file).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="JoinSnap">JoinSnap</A>
    <DD>
      The maximum distance between the endpoints of two splines before they will
      join with the Edit-&gt;Join command. This is measured in pixels in the char
      view and em-units elsewhere.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="StopAtJoin">StopAtJoin</A>
    <DD>
      When dragging points in the outline view, if the end point of one open contour
      is moved onto the end point of another open contour then those two contours
      will join. If you leave this Off then further motion will continue to move
      the points, if you set this to On then FontForge will stop noticing mouse
      movements (it pretends that you released the mouse button). This is useful
      if you hand jitters a little on the mouse.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="CopyMetaData">CopyMetaData</A>
    <DD>
      Controls the behavior of Edit-&gt;Copy from the fontview. Normally Copy does
      not copy a glyph's metadata (name, encoding, etc.) but if this is set then
      it will.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="UndoDepth">UndoDepth</A>
    <DD>
      Controls the maximum number of Undoes that may be retained in a glyph. (In
      some rare occasions an Undo will be stored even if this depth is 0)
    <DT>

    <DD>
      Figure out what points will be part of flex hints after every change to a
      glyph. Points which are at the center of a flex hint will have a green halo
      drawn around them. The criteria for flex hints are given on pages 72-73 of
      Adobe's

      TrueType instructions refer to points by number. So if you do any editing

      will be applied to a different set of points.
      <P>
      Sometimes the results are amusing, but almost always they are ugly and wrong.
      <P>
      This is very different from having out of date PostScript Hints. There the
      hints are probably just useless (as opposed to being actively bad, as here).
      <P>
      FontForge will normally delete all instructions to prevent this happening.
      However, if you are prepared to fix up the instructions after a set of changes
      you may prefer to have the instructions left. Be careful though!

    <DT>
      <A NAME="MfClearBg">MfClearBg</A>
    <DD>
      Loading a .mf font is a multi step process, first a bitmap font is generated,
      it is loaded into the background, then autotrace is invoked to trace around
      the backgrounds. These background bitmaps can take up a lot of space and
      you may not want them after they have been autotraced. Selecting this entry
      will remove those bitmaps from the font after they have been used.

      The mf program generates a fair amount of verbiage even when it is working

      Originally Adobe used the PUA (public use area of unicode) to contain glyphs
      for small caps, lower case numerals, etc. They have since changed their minds
      and no longer recommend this usage. FontForge normally recognizes names like
      "a.sc" as being mapped to the appropriate slot in Adobe's old view of the
      PUA. If you don't like this behavior turn this item off and "a.sc" will not
      have a unicode encoding.
    <DT>
      UnicodeGlyphNames
    <DD>
      Glyph names are supposed to be composed of ASCII letters and numbers (and
      a few other characters). At least they are when they are stored in a font.
      But when you are building a font and if you are not an English speaker, it
      might be useful to have a wider range of letters available for glyph names.
      You should never export these names when you generate a font (Use the Force
      Glyph Names to field of the generate dialog).

      Whenever a postscript font is generated then this last number will be incremented
      by 1.

      I have registered with Adobe and they have assigned FontForge (actually PfaEdit)

      InstructSerifs
    <DD>
      Try to detect serifs and other elements protruding from base stems and generate
      instructions for them: try to control distances between serifs' tips and
      their base stems.
    <DT>
      InstructBallTerminals
    <DD>
      Generate instructions for ball terminals. They need different handling than
      other kinds of serifs.
    <DT>
      InterpolateStrongPoints
    <DD>
      Instructing stems is sometimes not enough. This option makes FontForge to
      interpolate some important points (sharp corners, inflections, curve extremes),
      not affected by other instructions, between stem edges. Both parallel and
      perpendicular extremes are controlled. Agressive optimization is employed,
      to still leave as many points as possible to IUP, but manual review is
      nevertheless greatly adviced.
    <DT>
      CounterControl
    <DD>
      Make sure similar or equal counters remain the same in gridfitted outlines.
      This was inspired by, but works somewhat independently from,
      <A HREF="charinfo.html#CounterMasks">PS Counter Hints</A>. Enabling this
      option means that proper shapes are more important than proper scaling of
      advance widths.

      MS has changed the way it handles indic scripts and has created a parallel
      set of script tags for the new method. Set this flag if you want to create

      Someone from Adobe recommended that almost all features should be active

      features in the OpenType sub-table for the DFLT script.

  the "ligature" feature names, and the "common ligature" setting names will
  be added to the 'name' table).
  <P>
  You may also use this dialog to establish which setting(s) should be on by
  default in a given feature and whether the feature only allows one setting
  to be on at a time (the settings are mutually exclusive). All of this data
  may be overridden by the similar dialog in the
