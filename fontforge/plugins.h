/* If a user wants to write a fontforge plugin s/he should include this file */

/*
    I envision that there will eventually be three types of plug-ins. At the
    moment I am only supporting two of them.

    * A plug in which adds a new encoding to the encoding/force encoding
    	menus.
    * A plug in which adds a new scripting command
    * A plug in which adds a new menu item.
	(I haven't figure out how I want to do this last. So I'm not currently
	 supporting it.)

    A plug-in should be a dynamic library.
    Plug-ins will be loaded at start up if they are in the default plugin
    	directory, or a script may explicitly invoke a LoadPlugin() call
	and pass a filename.
    Each plug-in should contain an entry-point:
    	void FontForgeInit(void);
    When FF loads a plug-in it will call this entry point.
    I expect that this routine in term will call one (or more) of the install
	routines (though it can do whatever it likes):
	* AddEncoding(name,enc-to-unicode-func,unicode-to-enc-func)
	* AddScriptingCommand(name,func,needs-font)

    Once loaded, there is no way to remove a plug in -- but you can map a
    plug in's name to do something else.

    I am presuming that plugins will be linked against libfontforge and
    that it will have access to all routines declared in fontforge's
    header files. I do not expect to turn this into a real library with
    a true API. It's just a catch all bag of routines I have needed.
    It's not documented either.
