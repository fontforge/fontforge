    Writing python scripts to change fonts in FontForge
  </H1>
  <P>
  I assume you have a working knowledge of python (because I do not).
  <A href="http://www.python.org/doc/">Python documentation may be found on
  the web.</A> FontForge implements two python modules -- one great huge one
  called <CODE><A HREF="python.html#fontforge">fontforge</A></CODE> which provides
  access to as much of FontForge's functionality as I've had time to write,
  and one tiny one called
  <CODE><A HREF="python.html#psMat">psMat</A></CODE> which provides quick access
  to some useful transformations expressed as PostScript matrices.
  <P>
  In python terms fontforge <EM>embeds</EM> python. It is possible to build
  fontforge so that it is also a <A HREF="#Extension">python <EM>extension</EM>
  </A>(<CODE>configure --enable-pyextension</CODE>)
  <P>
  The fontforge module also defines several types

      <TD colspan=3><A NAME="python-init-scripts">Users</A> may define scripts
	to be run when menu items are invoked. Some of these scripts will want to
	ask users questions, so this section provides routines to determine if fontforge
	has a user interface, a command to add menu items, and various small standard
	dialogs to interact with the user. I do not currently provide a mechanism
	for allowing people to define special purpose dialogs (for example they might
	want to ask more than one question in a dialog, and I don't support that).
	<P>
	When FontForge <A NAME="starts">starts</A> (if it's a fontforge with python)
	it will look at the directories <CODE>$(PREFIX)/share/fontforge/python</CODE>
	and <CODE>~/.FontForge/python</CODE> and attempt to run all files in those
	directories which end in ".py". Presumably these files will allow people
	to customize the user interface to suit their needs.
	<P>
	Currently it reads the files in directory order (which is generally somewhere
	between creation order and totally random). It will read the system directory
	before the user directory.

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	  <PRE>import fontforge;

def nameGlyph(junk,glyph):
  print glyph.glyphname;

fontforge.registerMenuItem(nameGlyph,None,None,"Glyph","None","Print Glyph Name");

def neverEnableMe(junk,glyph):
  return False;

fontforge.registerMenuItem(nameGlyph,neverEnableMe,None,"Glyph","None","SubMenu","Print Glyph Name");

def importGlyph(junk,glyph,filename,toback):
  print "Import";
  print glyph.glyphname;
  print filename;
def exportGlyph(junk,glyph,filename):
  print "Import";
  print glyph.glyphname;
  print filename;

fontforge.registerImportExport(importGlyph,exportGlyph,None,"foosball","foo","foo,foobar")
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
	The first call will define a menu item in the Tools menu of the Glyph window.
	The menu will be called "Print Glyph Name". It has no shortcut to invoke
	it. It needs no external data. It is always enabled. And when activated it
	will invoke the function "nameGlyph" whch prints the name of the glyph in
	the window from which the command is invoked.
	<P>
	The second call defines a menu item in a submenu of the Tools menu. This
	submenu is called "SubMenu". This item will never be enabled -- but if it
	were enabled it would again call "nameGlyph" to print the name of the current
	glyph.
	<P>
	The last provides a way to import and export files of type "foosball" (or
	it would if the routines did anything).

      <TD>If fontforge has a user interface this will add this menu item to FontForge's
	<A HREF="toolsmenu.html#Tools">Tool</A> menu, either in the font or the outline
	glyph view (or both).
	<DL>
	  <DT>
	    menu-function
	  <DD>
	    This is the function that will be called when the menu item is activated.
	    It will be passed two arguments, the first is the data value specified here
	    (which may be None, indeed will probably usually be None), and the second
	    is the glyph or font (depending on the window type) from which the menu item
	    was activated. Its return value is ignored.
	  <DT>
	    enable_function
	  <DD>
	    This may be None -- in which case the menu item will always be enabled. Otherwise
	    it will be called before the menu pops up on the screen to determine whether
	    this item should be enabled. It will be passed the same arguments as above.
	    It should return True if the item should be enabled and False otherwise.
	  <DT>
	    data
	  <DD>
	    This can be whatever you want (including None). FontForge keeps track of
	    it and passes it to both of the above functions. Use it if you need to provide
	    some context for the menu item.
	  <DT>
	    which_window
	  <DD>
	    May be either of the strings "Font" or "Glyph (or the tuple
	    <CODE>("Font","Glyph")</CODE>) and it determines which type of window will
	    have this menu item in its "Tools" menu.
	  <DT>
	    shortcut-string
	  <DD>
	    May be None if you do not wish to supply a shortcut. Otherwise should be
	    a string like "Menu Name|Cntl-H" (the syntax is defined in the
	    <A HREF="uitranslationnotes.html#HotKeys">translation section</A>).
	  <DT>
	    submenu-names
	  <DD>
	    You may specify as many of these as you wish (including leaving them out
	    altogether), this allows you to organize the Tools menu into submenus. (If
	    a submenu of this name does not currently exist, fontforge will create it).
	  <DT>
	    menu-name
	  <DD>
	    The name that will appear in the menu for this item.
	</DL>
	<P>
	This will only affect windows created after this command is executed. Normally
	the command will be executed at startup and so it will affect all windows.</TD>

      <TD>This will add the capability to import or export files of a given type,
	presumably a way of specifying the splines in a given glyph.
	<DL>
	  <DT>
	    import-function
	  <DD>
	    The function to call to import a file into a glyph. It will be called with:
	    The data argument (specified below), A pointer to the glyph into which the
	    import is to happen, A filename, A flag indicating whether the import should
	    go to the background layer or foreground.
	    <P>
	    This function may be None. In which case there is no import method for this
	    file type.
	  <DT>
	    export-function
	  <DD>
	    The function to call to export a glyph into a file. It will be called with:
	    The data argument (see below), a pointer to the glyph, and a filename.
	    <P>
	    This function may be None, in which case there is no export method for this
	    file type.
	  <DT>
	    data
	  <DD>
	    Anything you like (including None). It will be passed to the import/export
	    routines and can provide them with context if they need that.
	  <DT>
	    name
	  <DD>
	    The name to be displayed in the user interface for this file type. This may
	    just be the extension, or it might be something more informative.
	  <DT>
	    extension
	  <DD>
	    This is the default extension for this file type. It is used by the export
	    dialog to pick an extension for the generated filename.
	  <DT>
	    extension-list
	  <DD>
	    Some file types have more than one common extension (eps files are usually
	    named "eps", but I have also seen "ps" and "art" used). The import dialog
	    needs to filter all possible filenames of this file type. This argument should
	    be a comma seperated list of extensions. It may be omitted, in which case
	    it defaults to being the same as the "extension" argument above.

    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD colspan=3>A contour is a collection of points. A contour may be either
	based on cubic or quadratic splines.
	<P>
	If based on cubic splines there should be either 0 or 2 off-curve points
	between every two on-curve points. If there are no off-curve points then
	we have a line between those two points. If there are 2 off-curve points
	we have a cubic bezier curve between the two end points.
	<P>
	If based on quadratic splines things are more complex. Again, two adjacent
	on-curve points yield a line between those points. Two on-curve points with
	an off-curve point between them yields a quadratic bezier curve. However
	if there are two adjacent off-curve points then an on-curve point will be
	interpolated between them. (This should be familiar to anyone who has read
	the truetype 'glyf' table docs).
	<P>
	For examples of what these splines can look like see the
	<A HREF="bezier.html">section on bezier curves</A>.
	<P>
	A contour may be open in which case it is just a long wiggly line, or closed
	when it is more like a circle with an inside and an outside. Unless you are
	making stroked fonts all your contours should eventually be closed.
	<P>
	Contours may also be expressed in terms of Raph Levien's spiro points. This
	is an alternate representation for the contour, and is not always available
	(Only if <CODE><A HREF="python.html#ff-hasSpiro">fontforge.hasSpiro</A>()
	</CODE>is<CODE> True</CODE>. If available the spiro member will return a
	tuple of spiro control points, while assigning to this member will change
	the shape of the contour to match the new spiros.</TD>

	format with one control point between adjacent on-curve points.
	<P>

	them).
	<P>
	The first format allows an arbetary number of off-curve points followed by
	one on-curve point.
	<P>
	It is possible to have a contour which consists solely of off-curve points.
	When this happens the contour is NOT started with a moveTo, instead the entire

      <TD>Adds position/substitution data to the glyph. The number and type of
	the arguments vary acording to the type of the lookup containing the subtable.
	The first argument should always be a lookup subtable name. If the lookup
	is for single substitutions then the second argument should be a string
	containing a single glyph name. For multiple and alternated substitutions
	multiple glyph names. For ligatures, a string of the ligature components.
	For single positionings the second through fifth arguments should be small
	integers representing the adjustment along that axis. For pairwise positionings
	(kerning) the second argument should be the name of the other glyph being
	kerned with, and the third through tenth should be small integers -- or,
	if there are exactly three arguments then the third specifies traditional,
	one-axis, kerning
	<P>
	If there is a previously existing entry, this will replace it (except for

	A feature-script-lang tuple is a tuple with one entry for each feature (there
	may be no entries if there are no features). Each entry is itself a two element
	tuple, the first entry is a string containing a 4 letter feature tag, and
	the second entry is another tuple (potentially empty) with an entry for each
	script for which the feature is active. Each entry here is itself a two element
	tuple. The first element is a 4 letter script tag and the second is a tuple
	of languages. Each entry in the language tuple is a four letter language.
	Example: (("liga",(("latn",("dflt")),)),)<BR>
	The optional final argument allows you to specify the ordering of the lookup.

	Stroke_width is the amount by which all stems are expanded.
	<P>
	Type is one of "LCG", "CJK", "auto", "custom".
	<P>
	Serif_height tells ff not to expand serifs which are that much off the baseline,
	while serif_fuzz specifies the amount of fuzziness allowed in the match.
	If you don't want special serif behavior set this to 0.
	<P>
	Counter_type is one of "squish", "retain", "auto".
	<P>
	Custom_zones is only meaningful if the type argument were "custom". It may
	be either a number, which specifies the "top hint" value (bottom hint is
	assumed to be 0, others are between), or a tuple of 4 numbers (top hint,
	top zone, bottom zone, bottom hint).</TD>

  <P>
  If you have configured fontforge with the <CODE>--enable-pyextension</CODE>
  argument, then when fontforge installs itself it will also set itself up
  as something that can be used inside of python (up until now we have been
  talking about using python inside of fontforge).

  once you do that you can invoke all of the above fontforge commands from
