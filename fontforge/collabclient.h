 * file on the wire to the server to bootstrap the session. If you
 * instead call collabclient_sessionJoin() then a new fontview is
 * created with the SFD from the server and any pending updates to
 * that SFD are downloaded and applied.
 *
 * Typically, the process that started the server will then call
 * sessionStart() to send the SFD over to that server. Other folks
 * who want to join the collab session will use Join() instead.
 * 
 * Both methods of starting the client will register for published
 * events from the server and apply them automatically to the fontview
 * (and its charviews etc). So the difference of how the session was
 * started becomes much less after the initial call to sessionStart or
 * sessionJoin.
