CAVEAT
 FontForge used to be called PfaEdit. Early releases may be found at
     http://pfaedit.sf.net/

INSTALLATION NOTES:
 This distribution may be in two formats, either it contains dynamic libraries
 or it does not.

INSTALLATION WITH DYNAMIC LIBRARIES
 contains two executables:
	fontforge -- a font editor
	sfddiff -- a program for comparing fonts
 man pages for the above
	fontforge.1
	sfddiff.1
 two libraries
	libgdraw.so
	libgunicode.so
 and some user interface files
	fontforge.{ca de el en_GB es fr it ja ml pl ru uk vi zh_CN zh_TW}.ui
 and a shell script
	doinstall
 which should put everything into a reasonable place (you probably need to be
 root to run it).

 If you want to edit CID-keyed fonts (for CJK fonts) you may want to pull down
 the cidmap package from http://fontforge.sf.net/cidmaps.tgz and move the
 contents to /usr/share/fontforge also.

INSTALLATION WITHOUT DYNAMIC LIBRARIES
 Otherwise the package will contain:
	A README file or two
	fontforge    -- the executable
	fontforge.1  --	the man page.
    You should:
	$ su
	# mkdir -p /usr/local/bin /usr/local/man/man1 /usr/local/share/fontforge
	# mv fontforge /usr/local/bin
	# mv *.1 /usr/local/man/man1
	# mv *.ui /usr/local/share/fontforge

    You may need to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH environment variable (and
    /usr/local/man to your MANPATH environment variable). If you use bash edit
    ~/.bashrc and add
	PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
	MANPATH=${MANPATH:-}:/usr/local/man ; export MANPATH
    Or if you use csh, tcsh, etc. edit your ~/.cshrc and add:
	setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
	if ( $?MANPATH == "0" ) then
	    setenv MANPATH /usr/local/man
	else
	    setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:/usr/local/man
	endif

BUILDING
    Just download the file fontforge_full-*.tar.bz2 which you will find on
	http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/index.html#source
    Move it somewhere appropriate (/usr/local/src perhaps?) and type:
	$ bunzip2 fontforge_full-*.tar.bz2 ; tar xf fontforge_full-*.tar
	$ cd fontforge
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ su
	# make install
    On those machines where I can't figure out how to build dynamic
    libraries you should substitute "configure.static" for configure.

If you want access to FontForge's type3 editing capabilities then
	$ ./configure --enable-type3

More complex installations
    "make install" will also install a few other things which are not part of
    the standard package, but which are useful for some people.
    CIDMAPS:
	If you are going to be editing CID keyed fonts you should also down-
	load my cidmap files from
		http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/cidmaps.tgz
	put that file in the same place as you put fontforge_full*.tgz, then
	    $ mkdir -p fontforge/cidmaps
	    $ mv cidmaps.tgz fontforge/cidmaps
	    $ cd fontforge/cidmaps
	    $ gunzip *.tgz ; tar xf *.tar
	    $ cd ../..
	And then proceed to do the normal install.
    DOCUMENTATION:
	You can choose to install FontForge's documentation on your system, then
	pressing the [Help] or [F1] key within FontForge will go to the local
	docs rather than those on the web.
	Download the doc bundle from
	    http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/index.html#docs
	Then (assuming you have not changed the install prefix)
	    # mkdir -p /usr/local/share/doc/fontforge
	    # mv fontforge_htdocs-*.tgz /usr/local/share/doc/fontforge
	    # cd /usr/local/share/doc/fontforge
	    # gunzip *.tgz; tar xf *.tar

BUILDING for OpenVMS
    Jouk Jansen has provided me with OpenVMS makefile scripts. There should
    be mms files in all the appropriate directories.

BUILDING without X11
    FontForge can be built without X11. You will probably only want to do this
    if your system lacks X (in which case configure should figure that out and
    do it automagically). But if, for some strange reason you wish to build a
    non-X version on a machine with X type:
	$ configure --without-x

BITMAP FONTS
 The program sort of assumes you've got some unicode fonts lying around.
 The program will choose fonts as best it can depending on what you have
 installed on your machine.
   Sources of unicode fonts:
	http://czyborra.com/unifont/
	http://math.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/Software/cu/
	http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/freefont
        http://bibliofile.mc.duke.edu/gww/fonts/{Monospace,Caliban}

DEPENDENCIES
 FontForge has more functionality if libpng and libungif are installed on your
 system. If they are not then you can find them at:
     http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
	 http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
     http://prtr-13.ucsc.edu/~badger/software/libungif/index.shtml

 FontForge also makes use of libuninameslist to be found at:
     http://libuninameslist.sf.net/

 FontForge's truetype debugger is completely dependent on:
     http://freetype.sf.net/
 The default configuration is useful to FontForge, but more functionality
 is obtained if you enable the bytecode interpreter (but note: you must
 have a license from Apple to do this). Instructions for doing so are
 in the file README.UNX in the freetype distribution.
 *** FontForge also needs to have the freetype sources available to it    ***
 *** when it builds (it needs some internal include files). The configure ***
 *** script can usually figure this out, but it is very time-consuming    ***
 *** you might want to say $ ./configure --with-freetype-src=<dir>	  ***
 *** where <dir> is the top-level freetype source directory		  ***

 Finally, if you want to do autotracing you should install
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/
 or
     http://potrace.sf.net/

RUNNING
$ fontforge -new
 Creates a new font
$ fontforge -nosplash
 (No splash screen in case you have a very slow X connection)
$ fontforge font.pfa font2.pfb font3.ttf font4.otf font4.sfd font5.svg
 Opens those fonts (sfd files are fontforge's own spline font database files)
$ fontforge
 Brings up a file picker dlg.
