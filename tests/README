This is a minimal testsuite for fontforge. I expect it will grow with time.

You can execute the tests by:
  $ <testdir>/runtests <fontforge>
(where <testdir> is the directory of the testsuite, and <pfaedit> is the
 pathspec of the fontforge program)

Before you execute any of the tests you must download the test fonts.
I do not provide these because most of them aren't my work. If you can't find
one of the requisit fonts, simply comment out the tests which use it. Each
test file (*.pe) contains a list of fonts which it expects.

These fonts must be placed in <testdir>/fonts/

test001.pe
  Caliban.sfd		http://pfaedit.sf.net/sfds/Caliban.sfd.gz
  Zapfino-4.0d3.dfont
  Zapfino-4.1d6.dfont

test002.pe
  HanSans-Bold.otf	(any other cid-keyed otf file would do)

test003.pe
  MunhwaGothic-Bold	ftp://ftp.ora.com/pub/examples/nutshell/ujip/adobe/samples/MunhwaGothic-Bold
			(any other cid-keyed non-otf file would do)
test004.pe
  mingliu.ttc		(any other ttc file would do)

test005.pe
  VKern.sfd

...

================================================================================

This directory also includes the file randomtest.c . This program takes a
directory of good fonts, makes copies of them, introduces random errors into
those copies, and runs fontforge on the result. If ff crashes it saves the
test, otherwise it deletes it. Then it tries another test.
