  <P>
  <CODE>sfddiff [-merge outfile] [-ignorehints] [-ignorenames] [-ignoregpos]
  [-ignoregsub] [-ignorebitmaps] [-exact] [-warn] [-version] [-help] fontfile1
  fontfile2</CODE>
  <P>
  <EM>Sfddiff</EM> compares (or merges) two font files (in any format
  <A HREF="overview.html">fontforge</A> can read) and checks for differences.
  <P>
  It will notice:
  <OL>
    <LI>
      any characters present in one font but not in the other
    <LI>
      any characters present in both fonts but which have different sets of outlines
      or references. The outlines may be compared so that only exact matches are
      accepted, or so that a fuzzier match is used (useful in compare that a truetype
      and postscript font are the same). Similarly references may be matched exactly
      or may match after an unlink.
    <LI>
      optionally will check if the postscript hints or truetype instructions are
      different.
    <LI>
      if the truetype 'name' tables match
    <LI>
      if kerning (and other 'GPOS' data) match
    <LI>
      if ligatures (and other 'GSUB' data) match
    <LI>
      Any bitmap strikes present in one font but not the other
    <LI>
      Any bitmap characters present in one font but not the other
    <LI>
      Any bitmap characters which differ
  </OL>
  <P>
  If the <CODE>-merge</CODE> flag is specified the following argument should
  be the name of an output file into which sfddiff will store a merged version
  of the two fonts. This will contain everything from fontfile1 as well as
  any characters present in fontfile2 but not in fontfile1. For any characters
  with different outlines or references, the background of the the character
  will contain the splines from fontfile2 (sadly references can not be placed
  in the background).
  <P>
  If the <CODE>-ignorehints</CODE> flag is specified, then no hint differences
  will be reported.
  <P>
  <CODE>-help</CODE> will provide a mini description and will list the available
  options.
  <P>
  <CODE>-usage</CODE> will list the available options.
  <P>
  <CODE>-version</CODE> will display the current version of <EM>sfddiff</EM>.
