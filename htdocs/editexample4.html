    <A NAME="accents">Building</A> accented glyphs
  </H2>
  <P>
  Latin, Greek and Cyrillic all have a large complement of accented glyphs.
  FontForge provides several ways to build accented glyphs out of base glyphs.
  <P>
  The most obvious mechanism is simple copy and paste:
  <A HREF="editmenu.html#Copy">Copy</A> the letter "A" and
  <A HREF="editmenu.html#Paste">Paste</A> it to "&Atilde;" then
  <A HREF="editmenu.html#Copy">copy</A> the tilde accent and
  <A HREF="editmenu.html#PasteInto">Paste it Into</A> "&Atilde;" (note Paste
  Into is subtly different from Paste. Paste clears out the glyph before pasting,
  while Paste Into merges what was in the glyph with the what is in the clipboard).
  Then you open up "&Atilde;" and position the accent so that it appears properly
  centered over the A.
  <P>
  This mechanism is not particularly efficient, if you change the shape of
  the letter "A" you will need to regenerate all the accented glyphs built
  from it. FontForge has the concept of a
  <A HREF="overview.html#References">Reference</A> to a glyph. So you can Copy
  a Reference to "A", and Paste it, the Copy a Reference to tilde and Paste
  it Into, and then again adjust the position of the accent over the A.
  <P>
  Then if you change the shape of the A the shape of the A in "&Atilde;" will
  be updated automagically -- as will the width of "&Atilde;".
  <P>
  But FontForge knows that "&Atilde;" is built out of "A" and the tilde accent,
  and it can easily create your accented glyphs itself by placing the references
  in "&Atilde;" and then positioning the accent over the "A". (The Unicode
  consortium provides a database which lists the components of every accented
  glyph in Unicode and FontForge uses this).
  <P>
  As an example, open the file: tutorial/Ambrosia.sfd, then select all the
  glyphs at encodings 0xc0-0xff, and then press
  <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Accented">Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Accented</A>
  all the accented glyphs will magically appear (there are a few glyphs in
  this range which are not accented, and they will remain blank).
  <P>
  FontForge has a heuristic for positioning accents (most accents are centered
  over the highest point of the glyph), sometimes this will produce bad results
  (if the one of the two stems of "u" is slightly taller than the other the
  accent will be placed over it rather than being centered over the glyph),
  so you should be prepared to look at your accented glyphs after creating
  them. You may need to adjust one or two (or you may even want to redesign
  your base glyphs slightly).
  <H2>
    <A NAME="ligature">Creating</A> a ligature
  </H2>
  <P>
  Unicode contains a number of ligature glyphs (in latin we have: &AElig;,
  OE, fi, etc. while in arabic there are hundreds). Again Unicode provides
  a database listing the components of each standard ligature.
  <P>
  FontForge cannot create a nice ligature for you, but what it can do is put
  all the components of the ligature into the glyph with
  <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Accented">Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Composite</A>.
  This makes it slightly easier (at least in latin) to design a ligature.

      <TD>Use the <A HREF="elementmenu.html#CharInfo">Element -&gt; Glyph Info</A>
	dialog to name the glyph and mark it as a ligature. Then use
	<A HREF="elementmenu.html#Accented">Element -&gt; Build -&gt; Build
	Composite</A> to insert references to the ligature components.</TD>
      <TD>Use the <A HREF="editmenu.html#Unlink">Edit-&gt; Unlink References</A>
	command to turn the references into a set of contours.</TD>
      <TD>Adjust the components so that they will look better together. Here the

      <TD>Use the <A HREF="elementmenu.html#Remove">Element -&gt; Remove Overlap</A>
	command to clean up the glyph.</TD>
      <TD>Finally drag the ligature caret lines from the origin to more appropriate
	places between the components.</TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <P>
  Some word processors will allow the editing caret to be placed inside a ligature
  (with a caret position between each component of the ligature). This means
  that the user of that word processor does not need to know s/he is dealing
  with a ligature and sees behavior very similar to what s/he would see if
  the components were present. But if the word processor is to be able to do
  this it must have some information from the font designer giving the locations
  of appropriate caret positions. As soon as FontForge notices that a glyph
  is a ligature it will insert in it enough caret location lines to fit between
  the ligature's components. FontForge places these on the origin, if you leave
  them on the origin FontForge will ignore them. But once you have built your
  ligature you might want to move the pointer tool over to the origin line,
  press the button and drag one of the caret lines to its correct location.
  (Only TrueType and OpenType support this).
  <P>
  <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><BIG>CAVEAT: </BIG></STRONG></FONT>OpenType engines
  will only apply features which they believe are appropriate for the current
  script (in Latin scripts, Uniscribe will apply 'liga'). Even worse, some
  applications may choose not to apply any features ever (Word does not do
  ligatures in latin).
  <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/specs/default.htm">Microsoft
  tries to document </A>what features they apply for which scripts in Uniscribe,
  but that isn't very helpful since Word and Office have quite different behavior
  than the default.
  <P>
  There are a good many ligatures needed for the indic scripts, but Unicode
  does not provide an encoding for them. If you wish to build a ligature that
  is not part of Unicode you may do so. First <A HREF="faq.html#new-name">add
  an unencoded glyph to your font</A> (or if your font is a Unicode font, use
  a code point in the private use area), and name the glyph. The name is important,
  if you name it correctly FontForge will be able to figure out that it is
  a ligature and what its components are. If you want to build a ligature out
  of the glyphs "longs", "longs" and "l" then name it "longs_longs_l", if you
  want to build a ligature out of Unicode 0D15, 0D4D and 0D15 then name it
  "uni0D15_uni0D4D_uni0D15".
  <P>
  Once you have named your ligature, and inserted its components (with Build
  Composite), you probably want to open the glyph,
  <A HREF="editmenu.html#Unlink">Unlink your References</A> and edit them to
  make a pleasing shape (as above).
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="charinfo-akhn.png" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="401" ALT="Char Info for Akhand ligature type"
      ALIGN="Right">Finally you should check that FontForge has marked your glyph
  as a ligature (and, if so, as the right kind of ligature). Bring up the
  <A HREF="charinfo.html#ligature">Element-&gt;Glyph Info-&gt;Ligature</A>
  dialog. You should see a line like:<BR>
  <TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; liga &nbsp;m longs longs l</TT><BR>
  or <BR>
  <TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; liga &nbsp;m uni0D15 uni0D4D uni0D15</TT><BR>
  In the first case you might want to add an additional line (by pressing the
  [New...] button:<BR>
  <TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; liga &nbsp;m longs_longs l</TT><BR>
  (assuming you have a longs_longs ligature already). While in the second case
  you might want to select the line, press the [Edit...] button and change
  the ligature type from 'liga' to 'akhn' (I don't know enough about Indic
  scripts to understand this distinction myself), yielding: <BR>
  <TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; akhn &nbsp;m uni0D15 uni0D4D uni0D15</TT>
