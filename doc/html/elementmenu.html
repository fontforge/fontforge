	  This dialog is not available in the bitmap view. It shows you what glyphs

	<DD>
	  Show any glyphs that have substitutions (ligatures, multiple subs, etc.)
	  which depend on the current glyph. So if you select "i", you might see that
	  "fi" depended on it as a ligature, and if you select "A.swash" you might
	  see that "A" depended on it as a 'swsh' alternate subs.

      <A NAME="MassRename">Mass Glyph Rename...</A>
    <DD>
      <IMG SRC="MassRename.png" WIDTH="429" HEIGHT="288" ALIGN="Right">This allows
      you to rename a bunch of selected glyphs. It can be used in two ways, either:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  You want to rename all the selected glyphs by adding a suffix to their names
	  (this might be useful if you are working with a small caps Type1 font that
	  you wanted to convert to an otf font, where the old convention was just to
	  name the glyphs as "a", "b" and so forth rather than "a.sc", "b.sc", etc.).
	<LI>
	  Or you can select a block of glyphs, and specify another glyph somewhere
	  in the encoding, then the selected glyphs would get be named by appending
	  the suffix to the sequence of glyphs starting with the one identified in
	  the dialog. (This might be useful if you wanted to add a small caps collection
	  to an existing font). In this case you may also specify a lookup subtable
	  so that the base glyphs would get substituted by the appropriate renamed
	  glyphs when that subtable was activated (this can't be done in the previous
	  case, because there are no longer any base glyphs)
      </UL>
    <DT>
      Find <A NAME="Problems">Problems</A>...
    <DD>
      This command is not present in the bitmap view. It will search for several
      common problems. In the glyph view it will select anything that needs to
      be fixed, in the font view it will check all selected glyphs and if any have
      problems will open them and select the problems. It will post a message telling
      you of each problem found. It brings up the <A HREF="problems.html">Find
      Problem</A> dialog to let you choose what problems to look for.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Validate">Validate</A>...
    <DD>
      Rather similar to Find Problems, but works with a much smaller set of things
      which are definitely errors, and provides an overview of the problems found
      in all glyphs of the font. See the <A HREF="validation.html">validation
      page</A> for more info.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Bitmaps">Bitmap Strikes</A> Available...
    <DD>
      This brings up a list of pixel sizes for bitmap fonts.<BR>
      <IMG SRC="bitmapsavail.png" WIDTH="317" HEIGHT="365" ALIGN="Right"> If you
      have bitmap fonts this will show their pixel sizes. If you remove a size
      that is in the list then that font will be deleted from the sfd file. If
      you add a size then that size font will be created and stored in the sfd
      file.
      <P>
      FontForge deals in pixel sizes, not point sizes. The conversion between pixels
      and points differs on different systems and indeed on different screens.
      A point is (approximately) 1/72 of an inch, a pixel is however big a pixel
      happens to be on your screen. Usually pixels range from about 1/72 of an
      inch to about 1/144 of an inch. Different systems support different screen
      resolutions as "standard", and FontForge tries to know about these standards.

      <P>
      Sadly your screen will probably not match one of the standard screens precisely.
      On X the standard resolutions are 75 and 100dpi, on MS Windows 96 and 120dpi,
      and on the Mac 72dpi. This dialog provides the conversion between pixel size
      and point sizes at these resolutions.
      <P>
      Normally the new glyphs are created by rasterizing the outline font. If your
      system has the freetype2 library installed (and you checked the "Use FreeType"
      box) then FontForge will use the FreeType rasterizer to generate bitmaps,
      otherwise it will use FontForge's built-in rasterizer (which isn't as good,
      but involves a little less overhead).
      <P>

      If you have changed the outline that a bitmap is based one then you should
      (at some point) look into changing the bitmap too. This command allows you
      to regenerate a subset of the glyphs in a given bitmap font. In the font
      view you can regenerate all selected glyphs, while in the bitmap and outline
      views you can regenerate the current glyph. You can pick what pixel sizes
      should be regenerated too (unlike the above command, removing a bitmap size
      from the regenerate list will not delete it).<BR>
      As before, if you wish to change a greymap you should refer to it by

      There are many <A HREF="Styles.html">standard variations</A> on Latin (Greek,

	  <A NAME="Embolden">Change Weight</A>...
	<DD>
	  This is a simplistic command to make the stems of glyphs darker or lighter.
	  It sometimes works.
	  <P>
	  For CJK glyphs it simply expands the strokes of the font outward.
	  <P>
	  For LCG (Latin, Cyrillic, Greek) glyphs it expands the stroke outward and
	  then moves everything below a certain point up, and everything above another
	  point down. This is based on heuristics and will fail if a glyph is even
	  the slightest bit unexpected.<BR>
	  For other writing systems FontForge will do something, currently it will

	  An italic font is different from and more complex than an oblique font.

	  an old one) with the appropriate name. So if you selected "A", "B", and "C"
	  it would create glyphs "a.sc", "b.sc" and "c.sc". It will create two lookups
	  one bound to 'c2sc' which maps capital letters to small caps, and the other
	  bound to 'smcp' which maps lower case letters to small caps. It will build
	  the appropriate small caps glyphs in the new glyph slots. This only applies

	  There are two reasons for doing this:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      In a PostScript Type1 or Type2 font it will (usually) reduce the size of
	      the code expressing the glyph slightly. (I don't think it can increase the
	      code, but there are certainly cases where the optimization will have no effect).
	    <LI>

	  <A NAME="CanonicalContours">Canonical Contour Order</A>
	<DD>
	  Order the contours so that the contour with the leftmost point comes first,

    <DT>
      <A NAME="Add-Extrema">Add Extrema</A>
    <DD>
      Not in the bitmap view. Both TrueType and Type1 say that there should be
      points on the contour where it reaches its extreme horizontal and vertical
      values. In the outline view, if any points are selected, this will add points
      at all extrema on splines between selected points. In the font view, metrics
      view (or if nothing is selected in the outline view) it will add extrema
      to a spline if: 1) The spline is longer than the em-size/32, or 2) the entire
      contour (rather than just the current spline) attains its maximum/minimum
      value at this point. If the added extrema is extremely close to an already
      existing point, fontforge may remove that point to avoid creating tiny splines.

	  which is rotated so that one axis is parallel to the line between the two
	  points that surround the selected point. The selected point will be moved
	  mid-way between the two on this axis, while its other coordinate remains
	  fixed.<BR>
	  That's an extremely complicated way of saying: If the selected point is connected
	  to two points which are on a horizontal line, then the selected point's x
	  coordinate will be midway between the two, while its y coordinate remains

	  This is similar to the above command except that it allows you to make a

	  axis. A region is defined as a collection of points, each one of which is
	  within some maximum distance of at least one other point in the region. The
	  purpose of this is to allow you to space out the stems of the letter "m"

      This changes the order in which contours, references and images are drawn.
      It is almost useless because this order of contours and references does not

      appear in the same order.
      <P>
      If you have a glyph which contains both contours and references, FontForge

      The first menu item will only build accented letters, the second will build
      general composite glyphs (fractions, ligatures, digits inside parens, roman
      numerals, etc.) as well.
      <P>
      If the current glyph is an accented glyph (and all the base glyphs and accents
      have already been created) then this command will delete anything that is
      currently in the foreground and put a reference to the base glyph and another
      reference to the accent glyph into the foreground. So if the current glyph
      were "&Agrave;" then a reference to "A" would be added to it, and a reference
      to "`" would be centered above the "A". <BR>
      If the current glyph is something like "agrave.sc" then it will be built
      using the rules of "agrave" but with ".sc" variants. So "agrave.sc" would
      contain "a.sc". For accents it will use "grave.sc" if it exists and "grave"
      if it does not.<BR>
      If <A HREF="editmenu.html#From">Copy From</A> is set to All Fonts then any
      bitmaps will have a similar process done -- that is bitmap references will
      be created (even in the outline glyph view).<BR>

      Only in the font view.<BR>
      Consider the letters "Alpha" and "A". Often these may be represented by the
      same glyph. This command which change the encoding slightly so that the encoding
      for U+0391 will refer to the glyph named "A". Note that this is subtly different
      from refering to a glyph named "Alpha" which refers to another glyph named
      "A".
      <P>
      Adobe suggests that you use a reference rather than giving to unicode code
      points to one glyph, but it is part of the font format.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Merge">Merge</A> Fonts...
    <DD>
      Only in the font view. If you are building a unicode font you will often
      want to merge in other fonts. You can, of course, cut and paste from one
      to the other, but that can be tedious, while this command will do it all
      in one fell swoop.
      <P>
      FontForge does the following when merging CID-keyed fonts:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  If the font in the window (the mergee) is a normal font and the other font
	  (the merger) is a CID keyed font, then the merger font is effectively flattened
	  and the result merged into the mergee.
	<LI>
	  If the mergee is a CID keyed font and the merger font is a normal font then
	  the merger font will be merged into whichever of the mergee's subfonts is
	  currently active.
	<LI>
	  If both are CID keyed fonts, then they should:
	  <UL>
	    <LI>
	      Have the same registry and ordering
	    <LI>
	      The supplement number of the mergee should be at least as big as that of
	      the merger
	    <LI>
	      The mergee should have at least as many subfonts as the merger.
	  </UL>
	  <P>
	  If these conditions be met then any CIDs from the merger which are not present
	  in the mergee will be merged into the same subfont of the mergee as they
	  came from in the merger.
	  <P>
	  This strikes me as somewhat problematic, but I can't think of a better solution.
      </UL>
      <P>
      FontForge will also copy advanced typographic features, kerning, ligatures,
      etc.<BR>
      If one of the two glyphs of a kerning pair is in the mergee and the other
      in the merger then you will be given the option of either ignoring this kerning
      pair or adding it to the resultant font. This happens if both the mergee
      and the merger contain a glyph, and the kerning pair is in the merger font
      -- if that glyph is the same in both fonts then you would want to include
      the kerning pair, but if it differs then you probably don't.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="Interpolate">Interpolate</A> Fonts...
    <DD>
      Only in the font view. If you have a bold font and a light font and would
      like to create a medium font, then you can interpolate a font between the
      two (or you can extrapolate a font that's even bolder or lighter). Your two
      fonts must have the same sets of glyphs, and each glyph must have the same
      number of paths (ordered similarly) and each path must have the same number
      of points on it, and must have the same references.
      <P>
      Examples: If you are interpolating from a light font to a bold one, then
      a medium font might be 50% between the two, an extra-bold font might be 200%
      and a thin one -100%.

      it is useful to compare two versions of a font and see what has changed.
      This command will allow you to check:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  The addition or removal of glyphs
	<LI>
	  Changes to outline glyphs
	<LI>
	  Changes to bitmap glyphs
	<LI>
	  Changes to the font's names (truetype 'name' table and some postscript names)
	<LI>
	  Changes to the font's glyph substitutions (ligatures and whatnot)
	<LI>
	  Changes to the font's glyph positioning (kerning and whatnot)
      </UL>
      <P>
      You can also use it to compare truetype and postscript versions of the same
      font. Normally fontforge checks to make sure all the splines match exactly,
      but you can also have it test whether a contour in one font is always close
      to the similar contour in another font, or whether a contour in one font
      is inside a reference in another (these are common when comparing PostScript
      fonts where the format loses references).
      <P>
      Comparing PostScript hintmasks is another somewhat iffy topic. There are
      often many equivalent (I think) hint mask possibilities, but I don't have
      a good algorithm for saying that they are equivalent -- especially since
      Adobe uses hints in ways which I find unexpected.
      <P>
      Finally you can have it place the outlines of each differing glyph from the
      second font into the background of the corresponding glyph in the first font.
      This can be helpful in correcting discrepancies.

      Only available in the Outline and Font Views. This command allows you to
      specify two layers within the current font and then checks that they are
      similar. In the outline view a message box pops up to say if the layers are
      the same or different. In the Font View, the view will scroll to the first
      glyph whch differs, all differing glyphs will be selected and a message box
      pops up.
