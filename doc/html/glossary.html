	    <A NAME="abjad">Abjad</A>
	  <DD>
	    Abjad is the technical term for the type of writing system used by Semitic
	    languages (Hebrew, Arabic, etc.), where there are glyphs for all the consonants
	    but the reader must be prepared to guess what vowel to add between two
	    consonants.
	    <P>
	    Both Hebrew and Arabic have optional vowel marks and are called "impure"
	    abjads. Ancient Phoenician had nothing but consonants and is a "pure" abjad.
	    <P>

	    <A NAME="abugida">Abugida</A>
	  <DD>
	    An abugida is somewhere in between an <A HREF="#alphabet">alphabet</A> and
	    a <A HREF="#syllabary">syllabary</A>. The Indic writing systems are probably
	    the best known abugidas.
	    <P>
	    In most abugidas there are independant glyphs for the consonants, and each
	    consonant is implicitly followed by a default vowel sound. All vowels other
	    than the default will be marked by either diacritics or some other modification
	    to the base consonant.
	    <P>
	    An abugida differs from a syllabary in that there is a common theme to the
	    the images representing a syllable beginning with a given consonant (that
	    is, the glyph for the consonant), while in a syllabary each syllable is distinct
	    even if two start with a common consonant.
	    <P>
	    An abugida differs from an abjad in that vowels (other than the default)
	    must be marked in the abugida.

	  <DD>
	    A linear unit equal to the point size of the font. In a 10 point font, the

	    size. An em-dash is a horizontal bar that is as wide as the point size.
	    <P>
	    An em-square is a square one em to each side. In traditional typography (when

	    <A NAME="em-unit">em unit</A>
	  <DD>
	    In a scalable font the "em" is subdivided into units. In a postscript font

	    512, 1024 or 2048 units to the em. In an Ikarus font there are 15,000 units.
	    FontForge uses these units as the basis of its coordinate system.

	    <A NAME="encoding">Encoding</A>
	  <DD>
	    An encoding is a mapping from a set of bytes onto a
	    <A HREF="glossary.html#character-set">character set</A>. It is what determines
	    which byte sequence represents which character. The words "encoding" and
	    "character set" are often used synonymously. The specification for ASCII
	    specifies both a character set and an encoding. But CJK character sets often
	    have multiple encodings for the character set (and multiple character sets
	    for some encodings).
	    <P>
	    In more complicated cases it is possible to have multiple glyphs associated
	    with each character (as in arabic where most characters have at least 4 different
	    glyphs) and the client program must pick the appropriate glyph for the character
	    in the current context.

	  <DD>
	    When creating fonts for complex scripts (and even for less complex scripts)

	    before they are ready for display. These transformations are identified as
	    font features and are tagged with (in OpenType) a 4 letter tag or (in Apple)
	    a 2 number identfier. The meanings of these features are predefined by MicroSoft

	    Sometimes it is important to indicate that a horizontal edge is indeed

	    stem. In this case a special <A HREF="glossary.html#hints">hint</A> is used
	    with a width of -20 (or -21). A ghost hint must lie entirely within a glyph.
	    If it is at the top of a contour use a width of -20, if at the bottom use
	    -21. Ghost hints should also lie within BlueZones.

	    <A NAME="glyph">Glyph</A>
	  <DD>
	    A glyph is an image, often associated with one or several
	    <A HREF="#character">characters</A>. So the glyph used to draw "f" is associated
	    with the character f, while the glyph for the "fi" ligature is associated
	    with both f and i. In simple latin fonts the association is often one to
	    one (there is exactly one glyph for each character), while in more complex
	    fonts or scripts there may be several glyphs per character (In renaissance
	    printing the letter "s" had two glyphs associated with it, one, the long-s,
	    was used initially and medially, the other, the short-s, was used only at
	    the end of words). And in the ligatures one glyph is associated with two
	    or more characters.

	    The German monks at the time of Gutenberg used a black-letter writing style,

	    designers (after printing spread south) sneered at the style, preferring
	    the type designs left by the Romans. As a term of contempt they used the

	    <P>
	    This sounds rather like OpenType -- except that OpenType depends on the text
	    layout routines knowing a lot about the glyphs involved. This means that
	    OpenType fonts cannot be designed for a new language or script without shipping
	    a new version of the operating system. Whereas Graphite tables contain all

	    Phantom points

	    In a truetype font there are a few points added to each glyph which are not

	    the advance width of the glyph. Truetype instructions (hints) are allowed
	    to move these points around just as any other points may be moved -- thus
	    changing the left-side-bearing or the advance width. Early versions of TrueType
	    supplied just these two phantoms, more
	    <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/instgly.doc">recent versions

	    <A NAME="point">Point</A>
	  <DD>
	    A point is a unit of measurement. There were three (at least) different
	    definitions for "point" in common usage before the advent of computers. The
	    one in use in the Anglo-Saxon printing world was the "pica point" with 72.27
	    points per inch ( 2.85pt /mm ), while the one used in continental Europe
	    was the didot point with 62 <SUP>2</SUP>/<SMALL>3</SMALL> points per 23.566mm
	    ( 2.66pt/mm or 67.54pt/inch ) and the French sometimes used the Mediaan point
	    (72.78 points per inch, 2.86pt/mm).
	    <P>
	    The didiot and pica points were so arranged that text at a given point-size
	    would have approximately the same <A HREF="#cap-height">cap-height</A> in
	    both systems, the didot point would have extra white-space above the capitals
	    to contain the accents present in most non-English Latin based scripts.
	    <P>
	    This has the interesting side effect that a font designed for European usage
	    should have a smaller proportion of the vertical em given over to the text
	    body. I believe that computer fonts tend to ignore this, so presumably european
	    printers now set with more leading.
	    <P>
	    As far as I can tell, computers tend to work in approximations to pica points

	    Originally fonts were not described by point size, but by
	    <A HREF="#type-size-names">name</A>. It was not until the 1730s that Pierre
	    Fournier that created the point system for specifying font heights. This
	    was later improved upon by Fran&ccedil;ois Didiot (whence the name of the
	    point). In 1878 the Chicago Type Foundry first used a point system in the
	    US. In 1886 the US point was standardized -- the pica was defined to be 35/83cm,
	    and the pica point defined to be 1/12th of that.

	    In traditional typography a 10pt font was one where the block of metal for

	  <DD>
	    PostScript is a page-layout language used by many printers. The language
	    contains the specifications of several different font formats. The main
	    (FontForge) manual has a section describing how
	    <A HREF="overview.html#PT">PostScript differs from TrueType</A>.
	    <UL>
	      <LI>
		Type 1 -- This is the old standard for PostScript fonts. Such a font generally
		has the extension .pfb (or .pfa). A type 1 font is limited to a one byte
		encoding (ie. only 256 glyphs may be encoded).
	      <LI>
		Type 2/CFF -- This is the format used within <A HREF="#opentype">OpenType</A>
		fonts. It is almost the same as Type 1, but has a few extensions and a more
		compact format. It is usually inside a CFF wrapper, which is usually inside
		an OpenType font. The CFF font format again only allows a 1 byte encoding,
		but the OpenType wrapper extends this to provide more complex encoding types.
	      <LI>
		Type 3 -- This format allows full postscript within the font, but it means
		that no <A HREF="#hints">hints</A> are allowed, so these fonts will not look
		as nice at small point-sizes. Also most (screen) rasterizers are incapable
		of dealing with them. A type 3 font is limited to a one byte encoding (ie.
		only 256 glyphs may be encoded).
	      <LI>
		Type 0 -- This format is used for collecting many sub-fonts (of Type 1, 2
		or 3) into one big font with a multi-byte encoding, and was used for CJK
		or Unicode fonts.
	      <LI>
		Type 42 -- A <A HREF="#truetype">TrueType</A> font wrapped up in PostScript.
		Sort of the opposite from OpenType.
	      <LI>
		CID -- This format is used for CJK fonts with large numbers of glyphs. The
		glyphs themselves are specified either as type1 or type2 glyph format. The
		CID font itself has no encoding, just a mapping from CID (a number) to glyph.
		An set of external CMAP files are used to provide appropriate encodings as
		needed.

	    Back two thousand years ago when the Romans were carving their letters on
	    stone monuments, they discovered that they could reduce the chance of the
	    stone cracking by adding fine lines at the terminations of the main stems
	    of a glyph.
	    <P>
	    These fine lines were called serifs, and came to have an esthetic appeal
	    of their own. Early type designers added them to their fonts for esthetic
	    rather than functional reasons.
	    <P>
	    At the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries,
	    type-designers started designing fonts without serifs. These were initially
	    called grotesques because their form appeared so strange, they are now generally
	    called sans-serif.
	    <P>
	    Other writing systems (Hebrew for one) have their own serifs. Hebrew serifs
	    are rather different from latin (cyrillic, greek) serifs and I don't know
	    their history. Hebrew serifs only occur at the top of a glyph
	    <P>
	    I would welcome examples from other scripts of serifed and sans-serifed glyphs.

	    The "state machine" consists of a table of states, each state in turn consists

	    special state called the start state, and reads the glyph stream of the text.
	    Each individual glyph will cause a state transition to occur. As these
	    transitions occur the machine may also specify changes to the glyph stream
	    (conditional substitutions or kerning).
