          <B>General:</B>
        <LI>
          Fix bug that caused incorrectly dumping some context substitution format 1
          lookups to feature files. We were also accepting the broken lookups we were
          generated and FontForge would crash later, now they are rejected, too.
        <LI>
          "TeX Names" is now accepted internally as an alias for "ΤεΧ Names" when
          specifying a name list by name.
        <LI>
          Typo in hhead generation code caused descent offset setting to be ignored and
          the ascent offset setting to be used instead.
        <LI>
          A new glyph name list based Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts, it is now the
          default when creating new fonts.
        <LI>
          No longer warns about using the names Omega, Delta and mu for ohm, increment and
          mu, respectively. Adobe fixed the names to point to the Greek letters, then
          later changed their mind and reverted back to the old names, so now we do the
          same.
        <LI>
          Fixed a crash in EPS import.
        <LI>
          FontForge is internally using doubles by default now, but can be still
          configured to use floats. Support for log doubles have been removed.
        <LI>
          Thanks to Lu Wang, fonts can now be loaded from PDF files using
          <CODE>filename(fontname)</CODE> notation from command line too.
        <LI>
          Increase the limit of entries read from encoding files to 65536 instead of
          1024.
        <LI>
          Support for v1.6 feature file syntax for mark classes have been dropped, v1.8
          syntax should be always used.
        <LI>
          <B>UI fixes and additions:</B>
        <LI>
          It is now possible to style vertical tabset layout differently than horizontal
          by means of dummy GGadget <CODE>GVTabSet</CODE>.
        <LI>
          Type3/multilayer, device tables and the paste after command are always enabled
          now.
        <LI>
          Cairo is now used for drawing all windows (when enabled) which improves the
          rendering overall.
        <LI>
          Char view palettes are now docked by default.
        <LI>
          A default resource file will be loaded at startup from
          <CODE>$prefix/share/fontforge/resources/fontforge.resource</CODE>.
        <LI>
          There is now a possibility to have a quick preview in glyph window
          by holding [`] key down. This doesn't work if quick navigation is
          turned on, but can also be toggled with [Ctrl]+[`] shortcut.
        <LI>
          There is now an option in Generate Font dialog to prepend a timestamp
          to the font family name. This is for font development only ant it
          enables simultaneous testing of different font versions in production
          environment.
        <LI>
          Improved translation coverage for error messages.
        <LI>
          Improved rendering of GTabSet.
        <LI>
          Fixed mnemonics clash (<I><U>N</U>ext</I> &amp; <I>Glyph <U>N</U>ame</I>)
          in glyph info dialog.
        <LI>
          Fixed mnemonics in contextual menu of layers palette and in problem detector.
        <LI>
          New and updated translations:
          <UL>
            <LI>
              Updated Polish translation from Michał Nowakowski.
            <LI>
              Updated Russian translation from Alexandre Proukodine.
          </UL>
        <LI>
          <B>Python scripting fixes and additions:</B>
        <LI>
          Thanks to Lu Wang, <CODE>LoadEncodingFile</CODE> now takes an optional encoding
          name parameter that is useful for loading Unicode consortium format encoding
          files, which were just ignored before.
      </UL>

          <B>General:</B>
        <LI>
          Thanks to Matthew Petroff, we have now a binary package for
          MS/Windows available.
        <LI>
          Thanks to Jose Da Silva, Unicode utils are now partially sanitized
          (which means less possible buffer overruns and memory allocation
          failures) and better documented.
        <LI>
          FontForge now takes x-www-browser, Google Chrome and Konqueror
          into account when trying to open help pages.
        <LI>
          Improved compatibility with UFO workflow with Robofab based apps
          by preserving letter cases in *.glif names.
        <LI>
          Fixed some crashes on X resource loading and saving that occurred
          because of bad image path or pixmap directory.
        <LI>
          Georg Duffner reported and helped to isolate a bug in parsing OS/2
          Version in Font Info in case the string "Automatic" was not localised.
        <LI>
          Configure works on mac again.
        <LI>
          Fixed compilation with XCode 4.3 on Max OS X Lion.
        <LI>
          Fixed a crash for fonts with kerning entries containing negative values.
        <LI>
          Patch by Sourceforge user serval2412 to fix some resource leaks.
        <LI>
          Patch by Khaled Hosny for calculating wrong x and cap height for some fonts.
          If glyphs checked don't have flat surfaces at the top, FontForge takes the
          mean. But it was dividing by the wrong value.
        <LI>
          FontForge didn't build on some systems where /bin/sh is synonymous with dash,
          yet the usual user shell is bash. Configure and libtool were thus using
          different shells, that turned out to be incompatible. Luigi Scarso suggested
          patching the makefiles with explicitly setting the SHELL variable.
        <LI>
           Path by Steve White to enable support for ASMO 708 codepage.
        <LI>
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4F37E48C.4020508%40newtypography.co.uk&forum_name=fontforge-devel">We needed to go back to old implementation of the fsType table.</a>
        <LI>
          Patch by Michael Terry to fix crashes for pngs having NULL for trans_alpha;
        <LI>
          Patches by Daniel Kahn Gillmor and Paul Flo Williams to add support for libpng 1.5.
        <LI>
          The names 'alefmaksurainitialarabic' and 'alefmaksuramedialarabic' in the Adobe Glyph
          List disagree with Unicode. The use of these glyph names is therefore discouraged.
          Patch by Steve White.
        <LI>
          Encoding ID should be set to 10 for fonts containing unicode characters outside of BMP.
          Patch by Steve White.
        <LI>
          Hunh. We aren't adding libintl to the library list when we find out that we need it.
        <LI>
          Patch from Johan Winge to fix outputting of 24-bit BMP images.
        <LI>
          Patch from Maxim Iorsh to fix a crash for very long lines in UI.
          Specifically, crash occurs when putting a very long list of glyphs
          (~300 characters) in chaining substitution dialog.
        <LI>
          Patch by Pierre Hanser to fix a segfault in validation code
          when there was an empty line in PS private dictionary.
        <LI>
          Patch from Paul Flo Williams to Fedora bug 694986.
          See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=694986
        <LI>
          Patch by Khaled Hosny to fix a crash when cancelling a warning
          about glyph name or encoding already being in use.
        <LI>
          Patch from Matthew Skala to fix PS "Stack got too big" error.
        <LI>
          Matthew Skala pointed out, that featurefile.c line 94 tests the
          pointer sc for being null *after* dereferencing it, thus segfaulting
          if it does happen to be null.
        <LI>
          Patch from Steve White, to fix various issues in the Unicode Ranges panel in the Font Info dialog.
        <LI>
          Khaled Hosny forwarded a tweaked patch from Werner Fink of LuaTEX team,
          fixing a warning on line 400 and 401 within ioescapestopped() of psread.c
        <LI>
          When reading a kerning class we did not check to see if we got back an erroneous coverage table.
        <LI>
          At some point, FF only compiled if configured for type3 fonts.
        <LI>
          Fixed handling PDF opacity and patterns/gradients behaviour with
          respect to the current transformation matrix.
        <LI>
          Kerning pairs associated with a glyph weren't properly reinstantiated when
          reverting that glyph from the original SFD file. This could result to crashes
          (e. g. when attempting to save the font).
        <LI>
          When displaying a pair of kerned glyphs in a tooltip box, FF would
          actually ignore the left bearing of the second glyph. If bearing was
          negative (e. g. in case of a combining mark) this could even result
          into a crash.
        <LI>
          A wrong Descender value has been written into generated afm files, if
          the font lacked typical glyphs with descenders.
        <LI>
          The gasp table version was ignored when writing and opening SFD files.
        <LI>
          Fixed a bug when loading a type3 font with references.
        <LI>
          Patch by Alexey Kryukov to fix a crash in matrix edit controls.
        <LI>
          FF wasn't reading cmap AT ALL for cid keyed files.
        <LI>
          FF's CID menu now allows 256 cid sub-fonts - it used to be 42.
        <LI>
          Fixed a crash when a context chaining lookup glyph-based subtable had
          no glyphs in the backtrack section.
        <LI>
          The routine which (re)calculated the line height of a matrix edit had
          a bug which caused it to look at (random garbage) characters after the
          end of a string. This often produced warnings about "bad utf8 string"
          or some such.
        <LI>
          Fixed handling of he symetrical smoothing flag bits for gasp.
        <LI>
          FontForge checks at configure to see if libintl and libintl.h are on
          the system. It did NOT check whether msgfmt was in the path. So if
          a user has installed macports/fink but not added the appropriate bin
          directory to their path the configure script would think all was well
          and would create a makefile for .po files. Unfortunately the make file
          would die because msgfmt would not run.
        <LI>
          The charview hint routines used a routine which could try to store
          5 points in an array that only held 4. The resultant memory corruption
          could cause crashes. Patch by Paul Flo Williams.
        <LI>
          Fixed a crash in Expand Stroke.
        <LI>
          Fixed some bugs in deletion of mark classes and mark sets in font info.
        <LI>
          <B>Python scripting fixes and additions:</B>
        <LI>
          'altuni' member of glyph object in Python API was not documented.
        <LI>
          Patches by Akiro Sakigawa to fix setting and changing os2_unicoderanges and os2_codepages.
        <LI>
          Patch by GUST Team to fix a resource leak in python scripting.
        <LI>
          Patch by Khaled Hosny to fix a memory corruption crash in python scripting.
        <LI>
          When loading an encoding from Python, one need to know the name of the
          encoding in order to use it, so it makes sense for loadEncodingFile() to
          return that name. Patch by Khaled Hosny.
        <LI>
          'fontlog' and 'comment' members of font object in Python API were not documented.
          Patch by Khaled Hosny.
        <LI>
          Patch from Andrew Miller to make python "addLookup" function actually work.
        <LI>
          A patch from Khaled, fixing a memory issue in python interface.
        <LI>
          Assign the correct meaning to the symmetrical smoothing GASP flags in the Python interface.
        <LI>
          Changing the unicode value of a code point with python did not mark
          the font's encoding as changed which lead to subtle errors later.
        <LI>
          New python command: <CODE>font.addContextualSubtable</CODE>
        <LI>
           Adxded a python entry to the "Change Glyph" dlg.
        <LI>
          <B>Opentype Features fixes and additions, mostly by Khaled Hosny:</B>
        <LI>
          Fixed a (probably) misplaced warning reported by Matthew Skala,
          displayed on openning an OpenType file with a design size and
          design range but no stylename.
        <LI>
          Optical size now gets actually included into fonts built.
        <LI>
          In contextual chaining substitution lookups the backtrack classes are
          ordered in reverse way, but feature file syntax expects them to be in
          natural order, as confirmed by Adobe. FF does this from now, but this
          breaks any feature files that expect the old, incorrect behaviour.
        <LI>
          Added support for feature files containing kerning classes with value
          records that can't be handled by classes. They will get converted into
          kerning pairs, like with AFDKO's makeotf.
        <LI>
          Changed behaviour of kerning right to left characters. Now it's the user
          who is responsible for specifying the kerning in the right order and for
          adjusting the right values. But this makes things predictable.
        <LI>
          FontForge was trying to output "pos" rules for the marks themselves,
          not base glyphs. It was also outputting the mark once for the base
          anchor (correct) and once for the mark anchor (wrong).
        <LI>
          FontForge will, from now, handle new, unescaped syntax for mark lookup
          tags in feature files.
        <LI>
          FontForge escaped 'mark' feature tag when exporting feature files.
          According to the specification, escaping is only for glyph names
          and CID indices.
        <LI>
          Ligature caret handling in feature files was broken; only first
          LigatureCaret declaration worked as expected, all subsequent ones was
          accumulating all previous ones. 
        <LI>
          Sometimes GDEF definitions in feature file were being formatted wrongly.
        <LI>
          Fixes by Alexey Kryukov to some issues reported by Adam Twardoch:
          <UL>
            <LI>                  
              In the 'size' feature the parameters were written with a locale-dependent
              decimal separator, while the decimal dotis only allowed by the spec;
            <LI>
              FF used to generate empty definitions for standard GDEF classes if there
              were no glyphs to assign to them, while they should have been omitted
              according to the spec. Although the class names in GlyphClassDef should be
              comma-separated, and the positions for omitted classes still should be
              indicated with commas.
            <LI>
              Moreover, FF would put some glyphs into wrong classes due to a difference
              between its internal standard class IDs and ones used in the feature file
              syntax.
          </UL>
        <LI>
          Any operation which required temporary expansion of kerning classes
          (such as displaying the "Kern Pairs" dialog) could result into a complete
          loss of pairwise (not class based) kerning data.
        <LI>
          Eric Schrijver requested that GLIF output be more similar to that of RoboFab's
          to make diffing files easier.
        <LI>
          Patch by Khaled to fix a bug in ff's featurefile processing
          of UseMarkFilteringSet.
        <LI>
          If a feature contained both multiple and single substitutions, then FF
          would lose the single subs. Instead change the single subs to multiples.
        <LI>
          <B>UI fixes and additions:</B>
        <LI>
          Zvi Gilboa pointed out that for FontForge to be listed under "show other
          applications", the <CODE>exec=</CODE> line in .desktop file needs to be
          terminated by <CODE>%U</CODE>.
        <LI>
          Tried to improve integration with EWMH. Not guaranteed to work at all!
        <LI>
          Fixed handling of HV Group Box (actually GGroup) in X resource editor.
        <LI>
          <img src="fftype32.png" height="32" width="32" style="display:inline"></td></tr>
          New application icons by Severin Meyer.
        <LI>
          Layers palette changes by Tom Lechner. It's now possible to manage
          layers without leaving the glyph view.
        <LI>
          Added support for UI icons with alpha-channel. Not enabled for Mac,
          because it happens to crash on some builds. This is still under
          investigation.
        <LI>
          New GGadget and new X resources for interface styling:
          <UL>

        <LI>
          Fixed styling of scrollbar border.
          Also made possible a different color for thumb's bed
          (using depressed background).
        <LI>
          Widget gradients changed.

	  When doing remove overlap on quadratic beziers (truetype) ff converted them

	  too.
	<LI>
	  See if we can improve conversion from quadratic beziers to cubic. There are
	  rounding errors involved in finding the "cubic" control points which mean
	  that the cubic term of the spline will be non-zero when it should be zero.
	  See if we can find better approximations to the control points, and be prepared
	  to force a small third order term to 0.

	  OT glyph classes functional again. Note that now the special handling is
	  applied only to the last column of a matrix edit control: if this column
	  contains text fields with function indicators, then those indicators are
	  always drawn at the top of the field by a such way that they should always
	  be visible.

	  If a font contains several sets of kerning classes (e. g. for different scripts),

	  result in selecting the combination with the {Everything Else} class from
	  the first set being processed, even if there are better matches in other
	  sets.
	  <P>
	  Also FF would still complain that the "{Everythin Else}" string in the kern

	<LI>
	  Two small corrections for metrics view:
	  <OL>
	    <LI>
	      Since the {Everything Else} class is now recognized by FF as a valid glyph
	      class, it was possible to occasionally modify a kerning value involving this
	      class in the metrics view. So when asking user if he is going to modify a
	      class-based kerning value or create a new kerning pair, inform him if one
	      of the glyphs from this pair has been actually matched by the {Everything
	      Else} class.

	  The scripting function "FontsInFile" did not support pdf files, and always

	  Update cidmap to CNS-1.6.
	<LI>
	  My cidmap files have always been a one to one mapping of cid to unicode.
	  But that's not what Adobe does. Many cids get mapped to several code points
	  each. So I've revamped the format to support this. The new map files need
	  the new code (obviously) so don't download one without the other.
	<LI>
	  An earlier patch added support for horizontal scrolling (shift trackwheel)
	  in the outline glyph window. This builds on that and supports it in (I hope)
	  all windows. Also adds support for apple's wheel which can do both horizontal
	  and vertical motion.
	<LI>
	  When ff calculated the size of a kerning subtable it was off by two bytes
	  per glyph in the coverage table. This meant that it would sometimes make
	  a table that was slightly too big to be supported and not realize it. I've
	  fixed the bug, and put in checks so that if there's yet another problem like
	  this, at list it will be reported to the user.
	<LI>
	  It is now possible to differentiate stems by width (rather than by direction)
	  in the "Change glyph" dialog. This approach produces better results for glyphs
	  like "N" or "g", and thus seems more logical even for the Latin script, where
	  vertical stems are normally "thick" and horizontal ones are "thin".
	  <P>
	  This patch also affects some gdraw internals, since the new layout of the
	  "Change glyph" dialog makes it necessary to dynamically switch the captions
	  of some labels, and the text strings should fit to the space initially reserved
	  for those labels. So it is now possible to assign a list of strings to a
	  label, just like if it was a list button.

	  one cell smaller than it should have. Well that's screen size and window

	  bit of the window is off the screen, it probably doesn't matter much.

	  When ff was started with a .ufo fontdirectory on the command line, it would

	  Richard Gitschlag and Khaled complain that the Glyph Info dlg says "Done"
	  rather than "Cancel".
	  <P>
	  There is a reason for this. The button does not do a cancel. It only cancels
	  changes to the current glyph, but the dlg can be applied to several glyphs
	  one after another, and any changes made to previous glyphs are committed
	  when the user changes glyphs. So the "Done" button only cancels the current
	  glyph.
	  <P>
	  However, I can change it so that it says "Cancel" until the user changes
	  glyphs. And in most cases the user is only interested in one glyph so this
	  will solve most of the problem...

	  According to the spec there are two different types of GPOS 'size' feature.
	  One specifies a design size and nothing else, the other specifies a design
	  size, a design range a style name and a magic number used to associate all
	  fonts in the same family with the same weight and style but with different
	  design sizes.
	  <P>
	  Fontforge was not very good about warning the user when s/he created something
	  which had some but not all of these attributes. (ie. a design range but no
	  style name). So add some error messages to the fontinfo dlg which makes these
	  checks.
	  <P>
	  FF would also not read in a 'size' feature unless it were in one of these
	  formats. So if the user created a 'size' feature with a design size, and
	  a design range but no style name, then FF would not complain, would happily
	  output it, but would not read it back in again. So be a little more lenient
	  in what we read in.

	  I have been trying for years to figure out how to apply least-squares to

	  system with no solutions. I realized last night that I was looking at the
	  problem wrong (of course). Instead of seperating it into x and y components
	  and minimizing errors in each, I should have been minimizing the sum of the
	  x and y errors. Simple. Worked first try. Makes stroking about 10-15 times

	  When doing square pens or polygons then long bendy splines will be broken

	  It doesn't happen automagically for circle pens, so add a little bit of code
	  that detects 90 degree slope transitions and inserts a point there. Results
	  are more accurate now.

	  occurance.
	<LI>
	  Barry complains that when a feature file creates glyphs which aren't in the
	  encoding then those glyphs aren't visible (until you reencode, of course).
	  This causes confusion. I think the solution is simply to encode the new glyphs.
	<LI>
	  Patch by Michal. Some of the strings for the new delta suggestor were not
	  marked for translation (also resizing the window didn't reset the scrollbar
	  properly).
	<LI>
	  Add a new python method glyph.preserveLayerAsUndo() to add an undo to the
	  undo list which will restore the layer to its current state.
	<LI>
	  embedded bitmaps in CID keyed fonts didn't work.

	  Patch by Herbert Duerr. With traditional 'kern' tables, windows has problems
	  with kerning glyphs which do not have BMP encodings. So produce a warning
	  in this case.
	<LI>
	  SVG kerning produced garbage. Two typos. Patch by Simo Kinnunen.
	<LI>
	  Bug in feature file (and hence UFO) output. When outputing a contextual
	  class-based lookup ff would crash if class 0 was unused.
	<LI>
	  Werner requests a command to check when a spline gets very close to the center
	  of a pixel as this might be a candidate for a delta instruction. That is:
	  Grid fit many glyphs at many pixel sizes and see which splines come close
	  to which pixel centers. This is a functional but ugly implementation.
	<LI>
	  Add mnemonics for the first 10 layers (Guide is _0, Back _1, Fore _2, &lt;user
	  layer 1&gt; _3, ...). Guide, Back and Fore already had mnemonics... Now they
	  have two.

	  <P>
	  then that will rebind Open in the charview and nowhere else.
	  <P>
	  Note that the string "CV*Open|Ctl+O" will not appear in the pot file, you

	  When listing all languages used in a script, ff would only look at gpos.
	<LI>
	  When creating an ellipse or rectangle, ff would round the points to be integers
	  -- but it would not refigure the splines after doing that (so the spline
	  polynomials do not actually reach their endpoints causing peculiar errors).

	  When reading a featurefile from a ufo there is no associated fv yet, but
	  there is an associated map. Use the map instead of fv-&gt;map when checking

	  FF was not translating the spiro point menu in charview.
	<LI>
	  Add a mechanism so user can specify a modifier mask to be applied to characters
	  for navigation. Used to be that user typed "a" and the glyph for "a" was
	  selected in the fontview (or the charview shifted to show "a"). No modifier
	  was used. Now I've added "NavigationMask|None" to the pot file for hotkeys.
	  If left as "None" then there will continue to be no modifier. If changed
	  to something like "Super" then the super key must be used.
	<LI>
	  Set Width (Set Right Bearing, etc.) from the fontview would change the width
	  of a glyph even if it were composite with a "use my metrics" reference.
	<LI>
	  If cairo was turned off, and a glyph had background images, then deleting
	  those images (Cut or Clear) in the charview did not update the display. (That's
	  a simplification, but is what it looked like).

	  Panov suggests that for cubic points, when we round them we should not round

	  If a tt control point were on top of an on-curve point, then ff would ignore

	  FF used to shift glyphs left if "build accented" created something with a

	  Change the contour direction tester so that instead of looking at the first

	  In the glyph view, add the option to check for self-intersections before

	  FontForge will now use libpango and libcairo if these libraries are present.
	  Pango provides support for drawing opentype text in any language, so it should
	  now be possible to provide po files for the Arabic and Indic languages. Pango
	  also draws anti-aliased text so the user interface should look nicer.
	  <P>
	  Cairo will draw anti-aliased lines and splines (and text as well). Cairo
	  also supports translucent colors.
	  <P>
	  If you have an old release of pango then it may not be able to draw on top
	  of cairo, in which case you won't see complex scripts drawn properly in the
	  outline glyph view (the only view in which cairo is active).
	  <P>
	  Start up is slower with either Pango or Cairo active because both use fontconfig
	  to initialize stuff and that can take time.
	  <P>
	  Cairo, and to a lesser extent, Pango can slow down drawing. Especially if
	  you use X across a wire (on a display not connected to your computer). The
	  slowdown depends to some extent on your video card, driver, X release, etc.
	  If you find these libraries too slow to be useable you may turn either off
	  in Preferences. (You may also turn them off at configure time).
	  <P>
	  The first time fontforge starts with pango (I think it's pango) enabled,
	  initialization is very slow -- several minutes -- do not be alarmed, it only
	  happens once.
	  <P>
	  Pango crashes on my cygwin system, so my cygwin build does not ship with
	  either pango or cairo.
	  <P>
	  The version of cairo available from fink on the mac (1.0) is too old for
	  it to work with fontforge (which needs at least 1.2). So the mac builds do
	  not ship with cairo.
	  <P>
	  The default initialization of fontconfig on the mac doesn't seem to find
	  any fonts. You should create a ~/.fonts directory and drop into it the fonts

	  Peter Baker says:
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	    In both "Show Grid Fit" and the TT debugger it used to be possible to turn
	    off the display of outlines in the foreground layer simply by unchecking
	    "fore". Now it can no longer be done, and as a result it's become more difficult
	    to check at a glance the overall effect of TT instructions. It would be nice
	    to have this capability back.
	  </BLOCKQUOTE>
	<LI>
	  HV points don't work well with quadratic splines. Too many cases where they
	  just specify an impossiblility. Attempt to improve on that. Merge on quadratic

	<LI>
	  When FF starts browsing the OFLib it creates a thread which requests the
	  new state of OFLib (ie. any fonts since last time I looked?). This thread
	  should die after it has read all the new stuff. It did die, but then someone
	  restarted it and the whole process repeated. Which might be ok -- we'd get
	  a new state whenever the site changed -- except that it meant a flicker of
	  the display every minute or so.
	<LI>
	  Nicolas Spalinger points out that a license search in the oflib dialog (of
	  fontforge) finds exactly the opposite of what was asked for (searching for
	  PD finds OFL and vice versa).
	<LI>
	  There exist sfds where the width of a glyph does not match that specified
	  by use my metrics on references. So when we read these guys in, fix up the
	  erroneous widths and complain.
	<LI>
	  Distributions no longer provide .so files -- unless you ask for -dev packages,
	  and sometimes those don't exist. This means that dlopening a library doesn't
	  work. I think that's really stupid on the distibutioner's part. What do they
	  gain by removing the .so file? But I won't even try to change their minds.
	  Instead try to open the appropriate foo.so.? file if we can't find foo.so
	  (Not always, but in the more important cases).
	<LI>
	  When deleting a mark-to-mark anchor class, then any mark glyph which had
	  both a base mark anchor point and a normal mark anchor point would have only
	  one of them deleted. The other would be a sort of ghost point pointing to
	  an anchor class that didn't exist and causing problems.
	<LI>
	  Jason Pagura points out that while the short cuts in menus may be changed
	  by the user, the short cuts which appear in windows without menus may not
	  be. So Cut/Copy/Paste in textfields always use Cntl-X/C/V rather than Cmd-X/C/V.
	  Fix this.
	<LI>
	  Add a resource to let the user set the background color of selected glyphs
	  in the fontview. Then Alexey wanted a way to set the foreground color of

	  Implement a concept of "master counters" (similar to PS counter hints, but
	  more flexibe). I. e. if there are two or more equal or similar counters in
	  the glyph, then references pointing to stems forming the first counter are
	  added to stems forming the subsequent counters. This can be used to implement
	  a sort of counter control in the autoinstructor.

	  There appears to be (what I consider to be) a bug in scim. If the Mod2Mask
	  bit is set in the event then it returns a keysym of 0. Other input managers
	  do not do this. And some input managers depend on having that bit set (it
	  is used on the Mac for Option processing for example). The upshot is that
	  if I want to do mnemonics (Alt/Meta key sets Mod2Mask) I must clear this
	  bit when passing info to scim. Since I don't know what input manager is attached
	  I must clear the bit for all managers. Which breaks some of them.
	<LI>
	  When doing completion in a textfield, if ff completed the entire string,

	  A <A HREF="http://typophile.com/node/49550">thread on typophile</A> exposes

	  that of it's companion roman font. (This is to correct for an optical illusion,
	  because vertical stems are slanted in italic they will be longer than the
	  corresponding stem in an upright font, and to the human eye they will look
	  taller (even though they are not)). So add an option to the Italic dialog

	  used integers for the coordinates instead of reals.
	<LI>
	  We used to move left and right point coordinates to the baseline for italic
	  stems, so that they may well fall outside of the glyph bounding box. So prevent
	  the situation where this could lead to a nan in spline creation. Also don't
	  change the slope of italic stems when resizing a glyph.
	<LI>
	  Clear should only clear anchors, hints and tt instructions if it is the last
	  foreground layer. We could get picky and clear hints when the last cubic
	  foreground layer went, and instructions whent he last quadratic layer went,
	  but I don't think it is worth the bother.
	<LI>
	  If we have a 'TYP1' sfnt with a kern table which kerns a glyph with no unicode
	  encoding, then FF would likely crash.
	<LI>
	  Oops. Typo in Generic change function. Crashed when doing change glyph on
	  a glyph with only references
	<LI>
	  Just as the paste command should only set the width in foreground layers
	  if all other foreground layers are empty, so the clear command should only
	  reset the width in similar conditions.
	<LI>
	  Internal conversion from fontforge splinesets to ff python contours would
	  often leave interpolated points showing in the contour.
	<LI>
	  When FF generated a default name for a lookup when adding a new lookup from
	  font info, that lookup index was always set to 0, which meant multiple lookups
	  for the same feature would stand a good chance of getting the same default
	  name. Do a little better.
	<LI>
	  Extend the small caps dlg to create petite caps if desired.
	<LI>
	  Fix an uninitialized variable in GXDrawGrabSelection.
	<LI>
	  FF would attach a mark to the first anchor point in the correct subtable
	  in the base glyph. It would not check for the correct anchor class.
	<LI>
	  Python contour conversions would often introduce a control point on a linear
	  order2 spline.
	<LI>
	  List of Panose letterforms was missing an entry from the middle so all later
	  entries were off by one.
	<LI>
	  "Fore" and "Back" weren't localized in one significant place.
	<LI>
	  Add a few more checks (when reading in) on the validity of the 'MATH' table.
	<LI>
	  FF would generate a bad MATH table if given a glyph with assembly data but
	  no variant sizes.
	<LI>
	  Dropping a drag and drop into the metricsview after the last character tried
	  to insert the drop before the first character.
	  <P>
	  Clean up drag and drop from the font view a bit.
	<LI>
	  I have been trying to attach marks to bases backwards. It is the mark which
	  moves, so the attachment should happen when we get to the mark, and we should
	  look backwards to find the base. I have been finding the base, and then walking
	  forward to find the mark.
	  <P>
	  My approach failed if the lookup contains multiple subtables and a base glyph
	  has two marks being attached, one from each subtable -- I would attach the
	  mark in the first subtable, but then having found a subtable that worked
	  would stop, and the second mark never got attached.
	<LI>
	  When dragging and dropping lookups, allow dropping a lookup subtable into
	  a different lookup of the same font (assuming it's got the right lookup type).
	<LI>
	  The recent patch to insure that [Imported] lookups from one font to another
	  came across in the right order didn't work if there were nested lookups involved.
	  The order of nested lookups is irrelevant -- unless they are also used in
	  a non-nested context.
	<LI>
	  Add the ability to define a "Group" by glyph color.

	  The Layers pane of Font Info randomly wrote memory when it was initialize.
	  This could cause crashes, and who knows what weird behavior.
	<LI>
	  Validate spent half its time validating the foreground layer and half validating
	  the current layer. This could cause crashes if the current layer was not
	  the foreground.
	<LI>
	  Fixed a bug in parsing old style CID files. (those with type1 charstrings)
	<LI>
	  FontForge's OpenType layout engine probably didn't do the right thing in
	  anchor positioning of mark-to-base lookups when the base glyph had been moved
	  by a previous GPOS lookup.
	<LI>
	  Still missing some unicode ranges from 5.1.

	  Turn off debugging if the user switches layers.
	<LI>
	  The truetype debugger really wanted to debug the foreground layer and not
	  any other.
	<LI>
	  When validating a font, and double clicking to bring up find problems in
	  a charview, then the layer setting of find problems was (usually) incorrect.
	<LI>
	  Add a command font.correctReferences() to python scripting to fixup cases
	  of mixed outlines and references (outlines get moved into a newly created
	  glyph and then a reference will be made to it). Also fix cases where the
	  transformation matrix can't be expressed in truetype (scaling by 2 or more,
	  for example).
	<LI>
	  Barry points out a typo introduced in the background layers patch which would
	  cause crashes in fonts with many layers.
	<LI>
	  Minor improvements and bugfixes in resolving stem conflicts. Also, lists
	  of HV stems are now built in stemdb.c, so rely on these data instead of doing
	  a double work in autohint.c.
