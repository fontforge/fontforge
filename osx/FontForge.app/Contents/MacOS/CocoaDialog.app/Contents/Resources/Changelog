2.1.0  Feb 26, 2006
	- Compiled as a Universal Binary
	- Intelligent resizing to accommodate --informative-text in
	  all inputbox dialogs, all msgbox dialogs, and textbox.
	  Same for --text in all dropdown dialogs.
	- New "filesave" dialogs
	- Added --packages-as-directories option to fileselect.
	- Added --x-placement and --y-placement to bubble.

2.0.0  Jan 2, 2006
	- Added bubble dialog.
	- Added secure modes for inputbox and standard-inputbox.
	- The application now runs as a background app. This means no more annoying 
	  menu or dock icon!
	- Some dialogs can be floated above all other applications.
	- Timeouts on several dialogs.
	- Intelligent button resizing
	- Added custom icon support to msgbox, ok-msgbox, and standard-msgbox.
	- Added --help options (still needs improvement).
	- Added --select-only-directories to fileselect.
	- Restructured project directory, code hierarchy, and refactored much of the code.
	- Cleaned up the look of several dialogs.
	- Progressbar won't be displayed right away, to prevent showing for
	  very short operations.
	- Bug fixes (string-input on inputboxes, missing deallocs).
	- New application icon.

1.2.2
	- (Didn't release)
	- Allan's patch

1.2.1  Jan, 2005
	- (Did I even release this?).
	- Wout's patch:
	  added --no-show, --float, --timeout and --help options
	  turned into a background app so that the dialog icon does not show
	  up in the menu bar. This, together with float, is very useful for
	  loginhooks.

1.2.0  Dec 28, 2004  
	- added dropdown and standard-dropdown controls.

1.1.3  May 11, 2004
	- fixed handling of multi-line input to progressbar.

1.1.2  May 10, 2004
	- fixed crash that would occur when printing return values containing 
	  non-Roman characters. Thanks to Nobumi Iyanaga for finding this.
	- added "debug" class method to CDControl and got rid of those 
	  printf()s.

1.1.1  April 26, 2004
	- starting to use x.y.z versioning (instead of x.y)
	- progressbar incorrectly printed error with --debug 
	  (runControlFromOptions: always returned nil, which should only happen 
	  on error).  This has been fixed.
	- progressbar character encoding bug fixed. should now properly handle
	  UTF8 labels read from stdin. see bug 942012 on sf.net page.  thanks to
	  J-F Boquillard for finding and fixing this.

	- added inputbox, standard-inputbox
	- textbox window no longer closes on escape unless there's a "Cancel" 
	  button

	  invalid.
