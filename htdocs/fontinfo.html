The Font Info dialog is available from all views. It allows you to name your
font, to set its <A HREF="fontview.html#Encodings">encoding</A> and various
other useful bits of information. In a <A HREF="fontview.html#CID">CID keyed
font</A>, there is a <A HREF="cidmenu.html#FontInfo">separate command</A>
to access the information for the font as a whole, the dialog looks the same.
The dialog is composed of many different sub dialogs.

<P>
Postscript fonts have several different names, but basically there are two
important ones: the family name (like Times) and the fontname (which is the
family name with a bunch of modifiers like Bold Italic Condensed tacked on
to the end. The FullName is designed to be read by humans, while the others
are for machines, this name can contain spaces (like "New Century Schoolbook-Bold
Condensed"). Finally there is the weight name. All of these names should
be in ASCII. If you wish to enter names with characters outside this range
look at the <A HREF="#TTF-Names">TTF Names</A> Section.
<P>
The copyright field can contain whatever you want to put there, but it's
a good place to put a copyright.
<P>
In most fonts the version field is a string (and so has minimal constraints
on it), but in CID keyed fonts it must be a floating point number.
<P>
Many of these names are similar to the english names of the TTF Names section.
If nothing is specified in that section then the names specified here will
be used by default in ttf files.<BR Clear=ALL>
<H2>
  <IMG SRC="fontinfo-encoding.png" WIDTH="369" HEIGHT="472" ALIGN="Right"><A
      NAME="Encoding">Encoding</A>
</H2>
<P>
This sub dialog allows you to specify the encoding for your font, and to
teach FontForge about new encodings.
<P>
There are two ways to change the encoding. The default assumes that the font
currently has a reasonable encoding, but you want it to have a different
one, here each character will be moved to the appropriate position in the
new font. However if you check the <SAMP>[ ] Force Encoding box</SAMP>, then
FontForge will assume that the characters are in the right order, but have
got the wrong names. It will go through and rename every character to match
what it should be in the new encoding (this is for cases where people have
given a font an inappropriate encoding but where the mapping from character
code to glyph is correct).
<P>
You may want to add characters to or removed characters from your font. You
can specify how many characters you want in the font here.
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG> some encodings have different numbers of characters,
and it may be hard to guess how many will be used. But if you have changed
the encoding but not altered the "Number of Characters" box, then the value
in the Number box will be ignored and the correct number will come from the
encoding process.
<P>
In a CID keyed font you are not allowed to change the encoding (in essence
because there is none), but the dialog will show you the
Registry/Ordering/Supplement for this font.
<P>
Not all font formats support all encodings. SVG fonts will always be output
in a unicode encoding, truetype fonts in either unicode or one of the CJK
encodings, type1 fonts only support single byte encodings, etc.
<P>
<A NAME="Interpretation">Sadly</A> the encoding is not always sufficient
for understanding the font's behavior. For example a unicode font designed
for a chinese system will look very different from a unicode font for a japanese
system (The same unicode character may map to very different chinese or japanese
glyphs). To handle this (and some other cases) FontForge has the concept
of "Interpretation". There are several cases in which this field is useful.

<P>
You can also use the font info dialog to add new encodings to the set that
FontForge knows about. There are three buttons that manipulate a set of user
defined encodings. As always these specify both a character set and an encoding.
The encoding has a maximum of 256 entries, but the character set may be larger
(up to 1024). This means that you can define a font with extra characters.
Since postscript fonts can be reencoded at runtime this can be useful.
<P>
The button <CODE>[Load]</CODE> allows you to load an encoding(s) from a file.
Currently the file must either be in the format used by the unicode consortium
for <A HREF="http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/ISO8859/">mapping ISO
8859</A> encodings to unicode, or it must be a postscript encoding array.
The first format looks like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>0x20	0x0020	#	SPACE
0x21	0x0021	#	EXCLAMATION MARK
...
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
A postscript file looks like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>/TeXBase1Encoding [
 % 00
 /.notdef /dotaccent /fi /fl
 /fraction /hungarianumlaut /Lslash /lslash
 ...
] def
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There may be more than one encoding in a postscript file. The encoding parser
is not smart. It will only read arrays specified like this, don't try any
of the innumerable other ways of specifying an array in postscript.
<P>
If the font has a custom encoding then the <CODE>[Make From Font]</CODE>
button is enabled. This allows you to name the encoding you have defined
for the current font.
<P>
The <CODE>[Remove]</CODE> button brings up a list showing all the custom
encodings and allows you to delete them.

<P>
This sub dialog contains a rather random collection of settings.
<P>
The Ascent and Descent are (in this current definition) Macintosh concepts
rather than Postscript, their sum, however, provides the size of the em-square
and that is very much a postscript concept. For postscript fonts this number
is set by strong convention to be 1000, while in most TrueType fonts it will
be 2048 (also a convention, but TrueType claims rasterization is faster if
the sum is a power of 2). Since both TrueType and Type1 (postscript) fonts
represent numbers as 16-bit integers ascent and descent must be less than
32767. TrueType is more restrictive and requires their sum to be less than
16384.
<P>
If you change the size of the Em you may choose to have all the outlines
(and kerning info) scaled to have the same proportion to the new value that
they had to the old.
<P>
The Italic Angle indicates the slant of the font. FontForge can attempt to
guess a good value for you by looking at the stems of certain letters ("I"
for instance).
<P>
The underline position and height provide a program using this font a hint
as to where it should place a line if it wants to underline text printed
in this font.
<P>
The XUID field is a collection of numbers separated by spaces and enclosed
in brackets. This allows you to specify the extended unique ID of the font.
If you have set the XUID preference entry then FontForge will assign values
to all new fonts (by appending a number unique to this font to the end of
your preference item). Adobe recommends that the XUID be changed every time
the font is changed, so each time you generate a postscript font, that font's
XUID (if present) will be incremented by 1 (This incrementing does not happen
in CID-keyed fonts, where the XUID behavior is too complex for this simple
trick). (The XUID field is only meaningful in PostScript fonts)
<P>
The UniqueID field is an older convention for the same purpose as XUID. If
you do not fill in this field then FontForge will pick a random number for
you in the allowable range. If you want your font to have no unique id then
give this the value of -1. If you have talked to Adobe and been assigned
a real UniqueID then you may use this field, otherwise leave it blank. (The
UniqueID field is only meaningful in PostScript fonts)
<P>
If you want your font to have <A NAME="vertical">vertical</A> metrics (generally
this means you are working on a CJK font) then check the <CODE>[*] Has Vertical
Metrics</CODE> checkbox. This will enable the Vertical Origin field, and
will mean that when you generate a truetype or opentype font a vertical metrics
table will be added. The Vertical Origin is the vertical offset from the
origin of the design coordinate system to the origin for the purposes of
vertical metrics.
<P>
If you check <CODE>[*] Quadratic Splines </CODE>then FontForge will use quadratic
<A HREF="overview.html#spline">B&eacute;zier</A> splines for this font rather
than cubic B&eacute;ziers, this means that FontForge will be using the native
spline format of truetype rather than postscript (or opentype). When FontForge
generates a font it will convert from whatever format is used internally
to whatever format is required for the font, so there will be no problem
if this is set incorrectly, but setting it correctly for your font means
you get a clearer idea of what the outlines will look like. I find quadratic
splines harder to edit with because each spline is less flexible (and a number
of FontForge's commands will not work on them), but the advantage of actually
seeing what your truetype font will look like may outweigh that.
<P>
If you have configured FontForge for <A HREF="multilayer.html">multi-layered
editing</A> there will also be a checkbox here to turn that on.<BR Clear=ALL>

<P>
<IMG SRC="fontinfo-private.png" WIDTH="376" HEIGHT="544" ALIGN="Right">This
sub-dialog shows most entries in the font's Private dictionary. The interesting
things in this dictionary are mostly concerned with hints appropriate for
the entire font. I shall not go into detail about the meanings of the various
entries, that is best understood by reading
<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/T1_SPEC.PDF">Adobe's
Type1 specification</A>.
<P>
Don't try to change these until you understand what they mean.
<P>
The dialog is shown at right. It consists of a list, an editable region and
a series of buttons. The list gives the names (keys) of the dictionary entries,
while the editable region displays the value of the currently selected entry.
To change an entry, simply select its key and then modify the value below.
<P>
For example the <CODE>BlueValues</CODE> entry specifies certain key regions
of the font in a vertical direction. For instance it might contain the baseline
serif, the x-height serif, the cap-height serif. It is expressed as an array
of numbers, grouped in pairs. The first number of a pair is the low end of
the region and the second is the high end. So in the example at right, the
value of <CODE>BlueValues</CODE> is <CODE>[-20 0 437 457 583 603 623
643</CODE>.
<P>
When the <CODE>[Guess]</CODE> button is enabled FontForge thinks it can make
a reasonable guess for the value of the currently selected entry. Often two
entries in the dictionary will be closely linked and guessing at one will
also guess at the value of the other (FontForge will warn you of this). In
this case if FontForge were to guess the value of <CODE>BlueValues</CODE>
it would also guess the value of <CODE>OtherBlues</CODE>.
<P>
The [Hist] button is similar, it will bring up a
<A HREF="histogram.html">dialog showing a histogram</A> of the values of
an attribute of the font. The hope is that this will allow you to pick a
good value for the entry.
<P>
You may also delete an entry from the dictionary with the <CODE>[Remove]
</CODE>button. Some entries (such as <CODE>BlueValues</CODE>) are required
to be present in any type1 font, but you may still delete them. FontForge
will simply guess at a reasonable value when it needs to generate the
font.<BR Clear=Right>
<P>
<IMG SRC="privatekey.png" WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="146" ALIGN="Left"><IMG SRC="privatekeymenu.png"
    WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="202" ALIGN="Right">The <CODE>[Add]</CODE> button allows
you to add new keys to the dictionary. Every key will be added with a blank
value, and you will almost certainly need to provide an appropriate value
for it. When you press <CODE>[Add]</CODE> a dialog pops up which allows you
to enter the key's name. There is a pull down list of known keys (that aren't
already in the dictionary), or you may add keys by typing them in.
<P>
Certain keys affect things other than hints. The <CODE>lenIV</CODE> entry
controls how much random padding is placed around the type1 strings when
the font is generated. Normally this will be 4, but if you want to save space
(4 bytes per character in pfb format, 8 bytes in pfa) you may choose another
value. The UniqueID key represents the font's Unique postscript ID. If you
provide a value here then FontForge will copy it into the UniqueID field
in the Font Dictionary. If you do not provide a UniqueID here, FontForge
will generate a random one itself (this is different from True Type's UniqueID.
They perform the same function but are formatted differently).

These entries are only meaningful for PostScript fonts.<BR CLEAR=ALL>

This sub dialog contains a few settings important on Windows platforms.
<P>
The weight class provides a numeric value describing the boldness of the
font. A normal face will usually have a boldness of 400, and a bold face
will usually be 700. This must be a number between 100 and 900.
<P>
The width class allows you to provide a numeric value saying how condensed
or expanded this font is.
<P>
The PFM Family is used when generating PFM files and classifies the font
into some rather broad categories (Serif, Sans, Monospace, Script, Decorative).
<P>
You can control whether you want to allow your font to be embedded into other
documents (most commonly pdf). You can restrict it so that it can never be
embedded, it can be embedded into documents that can be printed (but not
edited), it can be embedded into documents that can be edited, or it can
be embedded into an editable document and later extracted and installed on
a different system. You can also control whether the document producer is
allowed to extract the characters it needs and make a new font from them
(which saves space) or whether they must include the entire font if they
use any of it. Finally you can restrict the embedding so that only bitmap
versions of the font may be embedded. (meaningful in CID keyed postscript
fonts as well as TTF and OTF).
<P>
The Windows Ascent and Descent fields are badly defined in the OpenType spec,
which says that they should express the maximum range of the Windows "ANSI"
glyphs. If one uses this definition, non-"ANSI" glyphs are cropped. These
should be the maximum range of all glyphs to avoid cropping. But even that
will not always work. If you have a line with marks which are repositioned
with GPOS, then the marks may be cropped, so Windows Ascent should include
the repositioned marks.
<P>
This is too complex (and too ill defined) for FontForge to figure out, instead
FontForge gives you a couple of options.
<OL>
  <LI>
    You may set WinAscent and WinDescent directly. Turn off the "[ ] Is Offset"
    checkboxes and any value you provide will be used as is.
  <LI>
    Or you may specify an offset to be added to the maximum ascent and descent
    of the font (which FontForge will compute for you when it saves the font).
    If you don't have any mark to base data, then I recommend that you set the
    offsets to 0, and check the "[*] Is Offset" checkboxes.
</OL>
<P>
Both WinAscent and WinDescent should be positive numbers.
<P>
You can also specify the default line gap, or leading between lines.
<P>
And if your font has vertical metrics enabled (See General above) you will
be able to set the default spacing between vertical columns of text. (the
equivalent to LineGap in vertical text).
<P>
These entries are only meaningful in TrueType and OpenType fonts (though
the Embeddable entry (generally called FSType) will be set on CID keyed fonts
even if they are not in an OpenType wrapper.<BR Clear=ALL>

by the word processing program. If you have loaded an opentype or truetype
font then the original order will be maintained. As you add more features
they will appear at the bottom of the list (which may not be appropriate).
You may select a feature name and use the buttons to move it up and down

TrueType (and OpenType) fonts are allowed to have different names in different
languages. So a French user might see CaslonItalic displayed as CaslonItalique
in a font menu, while a German user might see CaslonKursive. There are about
20 different strings which may be customized into various different languages.
Customizing one string does not mean that you must customize the others (indeed,
usually only the Style string is customized).
<P>
If you don't include any values here when FontForge saves a font as truetype
it will create an entry with an American English language containing the
postscript versions of the strings.
<P>
The various strings and a brief description of their meanings are:
<DL>
  <DT>
    Copyright
  <DD>
    Allows you to specify the copyright message
  <DT>
    Family
  <DD>
    The font's family name
  <DT>
    Styles (SubFamily)
  <DD>
    This should (in English) have values like "BoldItalicCondensed". This is
    the most likely string to change in different languages.
  <DT>
    Fullname
  <DD>
    The concatenation of the Family name and the Styles name
  <DT>
    UniqueID
  <DD>
    This is a string that uniquely identifies the font in a human readable fashion.
    It's format is quite different from postscript's UniqueID and FontForge will
    create an appropriate string if you don't specify one (rather than copying
    from postscript).
  <DT>
    Version
  <DD>
    A string containing the version number of the font.
  <DT>
    Postscript Name
  <DD>
    (FontForge will not let you set this. It will always be set directly the
    the postscript fontname, only one instance of the tag is allowed in the font
    and it must be ASCII)
  <DT>
    Trademark
  <DD>
    A string containing any trademark information for the font.
  <DT>
    Manufacturer
  <DD>
    The name of the company that distributes the font.
  <DT>
    Designer
  <DD>
    The name of the person who designed the font.
  <DT>
    Descriptor
  <DD>
    A description of the font and its characteristics.

    This is to get around a quirk of windows where only four Style names are
    allowed per family, so font families with more than four styles would get
    different family names above, but the preferred family name would be the
    same. This should only be specified if it differs from the family

<P>
These settings specify strings for the windows platform. If you specify []
Apple Mode when generating the font it will also generate equivalent entries
for the mac (It will, always, generate two additional string sets by taking
the american english entries and creating a "Macintosh English" and an "Apple
Unicode (2.0)" set even if you don't specify [] Apple Mode).
<P>
Generally fonts will have a fairly complete set of strings in the American
English entry, with the Style string (and nothing else) translated into different
languages.

<P>
When you are setting the Style string in American English another button
appears in the dialog, labelled "Translate Style". If you press this button
then FontForge will attempt to figure out the style of the font and then
attempt to translate it into whatever other languages in knows about (essentially
the above table). It will only translate to a language for which it knows
all the components and for which you have not already provided a translation.
So if your style in American English is "BoldItalic" (and you have no other
style entries) then after you press the "Translate Style" button FontForge
will generate "GrasItalique" for French, "FettKursiv" for German,
"&Ouml;&Eacute;&Ograve;&Icirc;&Ugrave;&Ecirc;&euml;&Otilde;&Ograve;&Oacute;&Eacute;&#215;&Icirc;&Ugrave;&Ecirc;"
for Russian and "NigritaCursiva" for Spanish.
<P>
These names are only meaningful for TrueType and OpenType fonts.

This sub-dialog allows you to describe your font in 10 different dimensions.

This allows you to set the TeX font parameters (which are described in Appendix
F, pp 98-100 of the MetaFont Book). There seem to be 3 different types of
font parameters, those for text fonts, those for math fonts and those for
math extension fonts. The later two have additional parameters which are
accessible through the [More Params] button. The default values for the Math
parameters are probably reasonable. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>The default

your font).<BR Clear=All>

This allows you to keep track of arbitrary comments inside your font database.
It does not correspond to any postscript or truetype entity. It is intended
to store a changelog for the font itself, but could be used for other purposes...
<P>
Various font formats allow a random comment to be place in the font, but
no format makes use of it. This is primarily to be used inside FontForge.
The comment should be in ISO Latin1.

<P>
<IMG SRC="fontinfo-anchors.png" WIDTH="376" HEIGHT="544" ALIGN="Right" ALT="Font Info Anchors">
This sub-dialog allows you to control the
<A HREF="overview.html#Anchors">Anchor Classes</A> used in your font. Anchor
classes need a name and a tag. Generally you want to use the default tag
of 'mark' (but see the discussion in the
<A HREF="overview.html#Anchors">overview</A> of when you might not).
<P>
From here you may add new classes, delete old ones or rename old ones. You
may also bring up outline character views looking at the characters which
use these classes.
<P>
<IMG SRC="newanchor.png" WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="391" ALIGN="Left">The dialog
for creating a new (or modifying an old) anchor class allows you to give
that class a name and requires that you associate it with a set of
<A HREF="charinfo.html#Feature-Tag">scripts and languages</A>. You may also
set some standard OTF flags.
<P>
There are three different types of anchor classes (well there are four, but
FontForge doesn't need to distinguish between two of them), Mark to Base,
Mark to Mark and Cursive. When you create an anchor class you must select
which type it will be.
<UL>
  <LI>
    Mark to Base is used for connecting marks (diacritic marks such as accents)
    to base letters or ligatures
  <LI>
    Mark to Mark is used for connecting two marks together (when you have several
    marks that interact in their positioning when applied to the same letter)
  <LI>
    Cursive is used to join two letters so they will give the illusion of cursive
    script.
</UL>
<P>
Generally in OpenType fonts several Anchor Classes will be treated as one
unit if they refer to approximately the same set of base characters and have
non-overlapping marks An example: there could be two types of marks that
attach to the same set of letters, one attaching below and one above the
letter, each would have its own anchor class, but you would tell FontForge
to associate the two together by having them "Merge With" each other.
<P>
FontForge recognizes a special feature tag ' RQD' to indicate that this feature
is required for the given script/language. Such a feature will always be
applied.
<P>
Anchor classes are only meaningful when generating a truetype (ttf or otf)
like font with OpenType tables.<BR Clear=ALL>

This sub-dialog allows you to create and remove contextual substitutions

<P>
For a description of what a contextual feature might be
<A HREF="contextchain.html">see here</A>
<P>
This dialog allows you to create a new contextual feature by pressing the
[New] button. This is a two part operation, first you will be prompted for
the standard tag, script&amp;language combination, and flags, then (in a
<A HREF="contextchain.html">separate dialog</A>) you will be prompted for
the contents of the feature.
<P>
The [Edit] button will allow you to change the tags, script and flags (it
corresponds to the first part of [New]) and the [Edit Data] button allows
you to change the contents of the feature.

into Apple Advanced Typography tables too).<BR CLEAR=ALL>

  <A NAME="Mac-Style">Mac Style</A> &amp; FOND
</H2>
<P>
This sub-dialog allows you to set the mac style of your font. Normally FontForge
will be able to guess the style from the fontname (and various other clues),
but sometimes the name will be non-standard (or perhaps just in a language
FontForge doesn't know about), and other times you may wish to override this
default setting.
<P>
If you are happy with the default, just leave the Automatic button checked,
if you wish to override check the button next to the list box. You may select
any combination of styles (remember to hold down the control key to get multiple
selections) except for one containing both "Condense" and "Expand".
<P>
Note: If you want the style to be "Regular" then leave all styles unselected.
<P>
The mac style is stored in the header of an sfnt (truetype or opentype font
file), but is most important in creating mac font families.
<P>
The <A NAME="FONDName">FOND</A> name is only used for generating mac families.
