  <DL>
    <DT>
      <A NAME="AutoHint">AutoHint</A>
    <DD>
      Whether glyphs should be automagically hinted before a bitmap glyph is generated
      (improves the quality of the bitmap)
    <DT>
      <A NAME="NewCharset">NewCharset</A>
    <DD>
      The default encoding used to create new fonts. Normally this is ISO 8859-1.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="NewEmSize">NewEmSize</A>
    <DD>
      Specifies the default number of em-units in the em-square. For PostScript
      fonts this should be 1000, for truetype fonts it should be a power of two
      (often 512, 1024 or 2048 will be used).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="NewFontsQuadratic">NewFontsQuadratic</A>
    <DD>
      Splines in fonts may be either in quadratic or cubic format. TrueType fonts
      use quadratic splines while PostScript (and OpenType) fonts use cubic splines.
      When FontForge generates a font it will convert from whatever format is used
      internally to whatever format is required for the font, so there will be
      no problem if this is set incorrectly, but setting it correctly for your
      font means you get a clearer idea of what the outlines will look like.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="LoadedFontsAsNew">LoadedFontsAsNew</A>
    <DD>
      When FontForge reads in a font it will generally keep the splines in the
      format they used in the font (that is quadratic for truetype fonts and cubic
      for postscript). If you set this flag then all loaded fonts will have the
      same file format as that specified by NewFontsQuadratic above.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="GreekNames">GreekNames</A>
    <DD>
      Will cause most new fonts to be created with a greek
      <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Interpretation">interpretation</A>.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="ResourceFile">ResourceFile</A>
    <DD>
      FontForge will read <A HREF="xres.html">X Resources</A> from a property on
      the screen. But sometimes this isn't enough. You set this preference item
      to specify a file from which these resources should be read (those on the
      screen will also be read and will supersede those in the file).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="HelpDir">HelpDir</A>
    <DD>
      FontForge will search this directory for help files when the user presses
      [F1].
    <DT>
      <A NAME="OtherSubrsFile">OtherSubrsFile</A>
    <DD>
      Allows you to redefine the OtherSubrs routines used in type1 fonts. The file
      format is described at the scripting command
      <A HREF="scripting-alpha.html#ReadOtherSubrsFile">ReadOtherSubrsFile</A>.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="FreeTypeInFontView">FreeTypeInFontView</A>
    <DD>
      Normally FontForge will use the freetype library to generate glyphs for display
      in the fontview. This is a bit slower, but creates better images than using
      FontForge's built-in rasterizer. This preference item allows you to control
      whether to use freetype or FontForge's own rasterizer.<BR Clear=all>
  </DL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="prefs-editing.png" WIDTH="286" HEIGHT="379" ALIGN="Right">
  <DL>
    <DT>
      <A NAME="AutoWidthSync">AutoWidthSync</A>
    <DD>
      Whether you want the widths of accented glyphs to track the width of the
      base glyph (so if you modify the width of A then the width of &Agrave; will
      automagically change, if &Agrave; is built as a reference to A and a reference
      to grave)
    <DT>
      <A NAME="AutoLBearingSync">AutoLBearingSync</A>
    <DD>
      Whether you want left side bearings of accented glyphs to track the left
      side bearing of base glyphs (so if you shift A left, then the accent in &Agrave;
      will also be shifted left)
    <DT>
      <A NAME="ItalicConstrained">ItalicConstrained</A>
    <DD>
      Whether constrained motion in the glyph view should allow motion parallel
      to the italic angle as well as horizontal and vertical.
    <DT>
    <DT>
      <A NAME="ArrowMoveSize">ArrowMoveSize</A>
    <DD>
      The number of em-units an arrow key will move a selected point in the glyph
      view.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="SnapDistance">SnapDistance</A>
    <DD>
      The maximum distance at which pointer motion in the glyph view will be snapped
      to an interesting object (ie. a point, baseline, width line, etc.). This
      is measured in pixels.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="JoinSnap">JoinSnap</A>
    <DD>
      The maximum distance between the endpoints of two splines before they will
      join with the Edit-&gt;Join command. This is measured in pixels in the char
      view and em-units elsewhere.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="CopyMetaData">CopyMetaData</A>
    <DD>
      Controls the behavior of Edit-&gt;Copy from the fontview. Normally Copy does
      not copy a glyph's metadata (name, encoding, etc.) but if this is set then
      it will.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="UndoDepth">UndoDepth</A>
    <DD>
      Controls the maximum number of Undoes that may be retained in a glyph. (In
      some rare occasions an Undo will be stored even if this depth is 0)
    <DT>
      <A NAME="StopAtJoin">StopAtJoin</A>
    <DD>
      When dragging points in the outline view, if the end point of one open contour
      is moved onto the end point of another open contour then those two contours
      will join. If you leave this Off then further motion will continue to move
      the points, if you set this to On then FontForge will stop noticing mouse
      movements (it pretends that you released the mouse button). This is useful
      if you hand jitters a little on the mouse.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="UpdateFlex">UpdateFlex</A>
    <DD>
      Figure out what points will be part of flex hints after every change to a
      glyph. Points which are at the center of a flex hint will have a green halo
      drawn around them. The criteria for flex hints are given on pages 72-73 of
      Adobe's
      <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/T1_SPEC.PDF">T1_Spec.pdf</A>.
      This setting can be used to show you when those criteria are not met.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="GlyphAutoGoto">GlyphAutoGoto</A>
    <DD>
      In the glyph window this controls how ff behaves when the user types a normal
      character. If this is On then when a normal character is typed the glyph
      window will shift to display that character, if Off typed characters will
      be ignored.<BR Clear=all>
  </DL>
  <DL>
    <DT>
      <A NAME="AccentOffsetPercent">AccentOffsetPercent</A>
    <DD>
      The amount of space (as a percentage of the em-square) that should be placed
      between an accent and the glyph below it by the Build Accented Character
      command.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="AccentCenterLowest">AccentCenterLowest</A>
    <DD>
      Whether accents should be positioned over letters based on the center of
      the accent, or on the center of the bottom of the accent.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="CharCenterHighest">CharCenterHighest</A>
    <DD>
      Whether accents should be positioned over letters based on the center of
      of the letter, or on the center of the top of the letter.
    <DT>
      PreferSpacingAccents
    <DD>
      Whether to prefer spacing accents (Unicode 02C0-02FF) or combining accents
      (0300-036F) when building accented glyphs.
  </DL>
  <P>
  <IMG SRC="prefs-font.png" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="372" ALIGN="Right">
  <DL>
    <DT>
      <A NAME="FoundryName">Foundry Name</A>
    <DD>
      Used in generating bdf files (part of the X Windows font naming convention).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="TTFFoundry">TTF Foundry</A>
    <DD>
      Similar to the above except that it is used inside ttf files (the achVendID
      field of the OS/2 table) and is limited to 4 characters.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="XUID-Base">XUID-Base</A>
    <DD>
      The base
      "<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/xuid.jsp">XUID</A>". Should
      uniquely identify the user's organization. If present then every new font
      will be given an XUID generated by appending a random number to the end of
      this string (which should consist of a set of numbers separated by spaces).
      Whenever a postscript font is generated then this last number will be incremented
      by 1.
      <P>
      I have registered with Adobe and they have assigned FontForge (actually PfaEdit)
      an extended unique id base of [1021]. When you first start FontForge, FontForge
      will itself append a couple of random numbers to this to give you your own
      extended unique id. And individual fonts will get a fourth number added to
      that.
      <P>
      If you want you may
      <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/xuidregister.jsp">register
      directly with Adobe</A> for your own XUID base.
      <P>
      See also Adobe's comments on
      <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/uniqueid.jsp">UniqueID</A>s.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="AskBDFResolution">AskBDFResolution</A>
    <DD>
      Normally FontForge will guess at what screen resolution you intend based
      on the pixel size of the font (ie. 17 pixel fonts are usually 100dpi (12pt)
      and 12 pixel fonts are usually 75dpi), but sometimes you will have more esoteric
      desires. Setting this will give you more control, but you have to click through
      another dlg.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="PreferCJKEncoding">PreferCJKEncoding</A>
    <DD>
      This controls the loading of truetype and opentype fonts. If a font contains
      both an unicode encoding subtable and a cjk subtable, then this item allows
      you to pick which one FontForge will choose to decode.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="HintForGen">HintForGen</A>
    <DD>
      Whether glyphs should be automagically hinted before a font is generated.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="AlwaysGenApple">AlwaysGenApple</A>
    <DD>
      If you always want to generate Apple style TTF fonts (and never windows ones)
      then select this item.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="AlwaysGenOpenType">AlwaysGenOpenType</A>
    <DD>
      Conversely you may always want to include OpenType tables in a font. It is
      permissible to set both this and AlwaysGenApple, or to set neither.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="PreserveTables">PreserveTables</A>
    <DD>
      A string containing a list of 4 letter table tags separated by commas. When
      loading an SFNT (ttf/otf) file, any table in the font with one of these tags
      will be preserved without interpretation. (Note: If FontForge thinks it
      understands the table it will parse it rather than preserving it).
    <DT>
      <A NAME="NewFontNameList">NewFontNameList</A>
    <DD>
      Specifies the namelist that will be attached to any new font. This list will
      be used to name any glyphs created in that font. See the section on
      <A HREF="encodingmenu.html#namelist">namelists</A> for more
      information.<BR Clear=ALL>
  </DL>
  <DL>
    <DT>
      <IMG SRC="prefs-apps.png" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="372" ALIGN="Right"><A NAME="PreferPotrace">PreferPotrace</A>
    <DD>
      If you system has both potrace and autotrace installed this allows you to
      specify which you'd prefer FontForge to use for autotracing.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="AutotraceArgs">AutotraceArgs</A>
    <DD>
      This allows you to specify any arguments you want passed to the autotrace
      program. Don't try to pass something that will change the input or output
      format or set input or output files.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="AutotraceAsk">AutotraceAsk</A>
    <DD>
      If this is set then each time autotrace is invoked it will ask you for arguments.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="MfArgs">MfArgs</A>
    <DD>
      This is the command passed to the mf (MetaFont) program which controls conversion
      of .mf files into bitmaps.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="MfClearBg">MfClearBg</A>
    <DD>
      Loading a .mf font is a multi step process, first a bitmap font is generated,
      it is loaded into the background, then autotrace is invoked to trace around
      the backgrounds. These background bitmaps can take up a lot of space and
      you may not want them after they have been autotraced. Selecting this entry
      will remove those bitmaps from the font after they have been used.
    <DT>
      <A NAME="MfShowErr">MfShowErr</A>
    <DD>
      The mf program generates a fair amount of verbiage even when it is working
      correctly. And if it is working correctly you don't want to see those words.
      So normally FontForge suppresses messages from mf. But if something goes
      wrong you do want to see mf's output and setting this will allow you to do
      so.<BR Clear=all>

  <IMG SRC="prefs-script.png" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="372" ALIGN="Right"><A NAME="scripts">This
  section </A>of the dialog allows you to define built in scripts that will
  show up in the <A HREF="filemenu.html#ScriptMenu">script menu</A>. Each entry
  has two things associated with it, the menu name and a script file. The menu
  name will be the name of this entry inside the script menu, and the
  <A HREF="scripting.html">script file</A> will be the filename of the file
  to be invoked. The "..." button allows you to browse for script files, which
  I think have extension .pe (but which can have whatever extension you prefer

  <IMG SRC="prefs-macfeat.png" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="372" ALIGN="Right">The
  <A NAME="Mac">Mac</A> Features dialog allows you to define a set of default
  names (in many languages) for mac features and settings. These names are
  placed in the 'name' table whenever a feature/setting is used in a generated
  'morx' table. (Thus if you have some common ligatures in your font, then
  the "ligature" feature names, and the "common ligature" setting names will
  be added to the 'name' table).
  <P>
  You may also use this dialog to establish which setting(s) should be on by
  default in a given feature and whether the feature only allows one setting
  to be on at a time (the settings are mutually exclusive). All of this data
  may be overridden by the similar dialog in the
  <A HREF="fontinfo.html#Mac-Features">Element-&gt;Font Info </A>dialog.

  languages, and you should provide settings for the feature.
  <P>
  To add a new name press the [New] button under the name list and you will
  be prompted for a language and a name.
  <P>
  To add a new setting press the [New] button under the setting list. The setting
  dialog contains the numeric value of this setting (Apple has decreed that
  if the feature is not mutually exclusive, all settings must be even numbers),
  whether this setting is on by default, and then a list of names for the setting
  in as many languages as you like.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
